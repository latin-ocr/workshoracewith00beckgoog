s. nram ω. Hebrumque] 'rho first of these a aa Lasia fonn or the

Goeek Θρῄκη. It has been observed before, that Horace generally uses the

Latin terminationis in the Satires and Epistles, and the Greek in the, Odes.

-The Hebrus he elsewhere calls “ hiemis sodalem '’ (C. i. 25. 19). Tiberius

passed through Macedonia and Thmee on his way to Armenia. (See Intro-
uction.

4. 221·QO inter currenni: turrea] ‘ Turris ' may mean a castle or fortified
place, and one of these that Horace mentions is robably Abydos, ou the
Asiatic shore of the Hellespont. The other may ave been Sestos, on the
European side. The strait takes a bend to the northeast between the two
towns, and Abydos stood ditectly south of Sestos, at thc distance of thirty
stadia. The current runs very strong between them, and this is expressed
in the text3 notwithstanding which, there is a po ular story that Leander, a
youth of Abydos, swam across repeatedly by nigsst, to visit Hero, the priest-
ess of Venus, at Sestos. Ovid has two Epistles, supposed to have passed
between the lovers (Heroid. 18, 19) ; and Virgil (Georg. iii. 258, sqq.) refers
to the story. The same adventure was aceom lished by Lord Byron and-a

is sometimes used in a bad sense, as we use ‘ assumc,' ‘ presume'; but it ts
not so here. It is the word Horace generally uses in this connection. See
A. Ρ. 38. With ‘diffundit in aevum compare C. iv. 14, init.

9. Quid Titius Romana] of Titius the Scholiasts say, that he was a tragic
and lyric poet. According to Horace, he was not afraid to imitate Pindar.
This young man was more rash than Horace himself (C. iv, 2. ι). There is,
no one upon record with whom the person in the text can be identified,
though some suppose he may be the person Tibullus mentions (i. 4. 73),
‘⁸ Haec mihi quae canerem Titio Deus edidit ore.''

venturus in eru 7] This expression may have taken its rise from Ennius's
“volito vivu' per ora virum,' which Virgil has imitated once or twice.

10. mugiit] This is used asin C. iii. 27. 27, “mediasque fmudes Pal·
luit audax!

ll. lacus et rivos aumas apertam] These are opposed to the deep and hid-
den springs of Pindar's genius,

14. An tch'ea desaevit et ampullatur] The first of these words refers to the

assions tepmsented in n-agedy, the other to the pompous words employed
by inferior writers to express them. ‘Ampulla ’ signifies a sort of bottle
with a big round belly, and eorrcs nds ιο the Greek λῆκυθος, which was
used ιο signify great, swelling weng) Horace appears to have been the first
to substitute the Latin words ⁴ ampullari “ and ‘ ampulla ' (the first of which

he probabi eoined) for ληκυθῖζειν and λήκυθος. See A. P. 97. ,

15. Qui mihi Celsus it ἲ] · Quid agis ’ is the common formula sor
‘Howd’ do'l’ See .i.9.4;1·3p.1.8.3. Celsusismost robably
Celsus binovanus, to whom the eig th Epistle is addressed. c know
nothing of him, except that he was one of the staff of Tiberius, and his secre-
tar'y (“ comiti scribaeque Neronis,’' 8. 2). The advice Horace here sends
him is, to write something original, and not confine himself to the ideas of
other authors, either in the way of translation or imitation. It has been men-
tioned before (C. i. 31, Introduction) that Augustus attached a lib to the
temple he built for Apollo on the Mons Palatinus. AEsop's fable of ‘ack-
daw, who dressed himself in the peacock’s casuoff feathers, is told by i’hae-

drus (i. 3). §Kadmos κολοιός was a· proverb. · ι
