tatione, cannot open his lips when he gets to Rome, and is only lau ed at
by the people for his sobi-iety‚ This is an odd defence for one w o had
written so much as he had done at Rome. It is meant for a joke. ‘ Septem
annis' is not to be taken literally, as if Horace had been seven years at
Athens, which is very improbable, but for any considerable number. He
was onl twenty-two when he 'oined Brutus, Α. u. c. 711.

and it does not matter. One was a jurisconsultus (see S. ·i. l. 9, n.)‚ and the
other a toacher of rhetoric. The lawyer said the rhetorician was a perfect
Gracchus for eloquenee, and he returned the complimcnt by declarin that
his brother was a second Scaevola for legal learning. And this sort o mu-
tual flattery goes on, Horace says, among poeta, and he cannot keep pace
with their passion sor praise. Tiberius Gracchus and his brother Caius wem
both, in Cicero's opinion, great orators. We need not therefore attempt to
decide which Horace means us to understand here. Q. Mucius Scaevola the
augur, son-in-law of C. Laelius, and an early instructor of Cicero (lael. c. 1),
was learned in the law; but his namesake and younger contempo , e
Pontifex Maximus (mentioned in the same treatise), was more cele rated
still. This name, therefore, like that of Gracchus for oratory, stands for a

flattery, that they are like two gladiator-s. each trying· to get the better of the
