probably that got it the name ‘annularis’ its supposed anatomia! eonnec-

Maecenas and his party.

29. Ue nul continuo [totuin] The nature and importunos of the duties ot
Nomentanus were shown on that occasion, when he handed andmiuu a
duint he had never tasted before, or perhaps heard of, and yet these gentle-
men new what good living was.

34. Nos nasi daemone bibimus] See Terence ( Heant. v. 4. 9) :—

“ 010. At ego si me metuis mores cave esso in te istos sentiam.
GL Quods'ss Cla. Si scire vis ego dicun: gerru, iners, fraus, helluo, Gneo,
amnosus.” .
Vibidius means, that if this stupid dianer is to be the death of them, they had
better have their revenge before-hand, and drink minoas-ly of the host's wine:
if they do not, they will die unavenged. ‘ Moriemur inulti ’ is bon-owed from
the Epic style. See Aen. ii. 670; iv. 659.

35. Vertere pmllor Tum parochi ficiem} Fundanius givos two reasons why
tho host turned pale when he heard his guests eall sor larger caps : bom
when men have drank well they give a loose rein to their tongues, and bemus·
wine spoils the alate by destroying the delicat-y of its tasto- He might prob-
ably have addeXa third, for it scenis that in the midst of his ostentation the

From the text we are led to suppose that eups were made there. ‘ Vinaria·
is properly an adjective, and agrees with ‘ vasa ’ understood. It means hem
the ‘lagena' or ‘amphorass which differe-d in sliam, but not in uso. Both
were vessels either os clay, or sometimes latterly of guise, in which tho wine
was ke t. Their contents were usually poured into a ‘crater’ for tho pur*-
pose otpbeing mixed with water. These persons helped themselves from the
‘ lagena,' and all followed their example, except the master and his two ptr·- .
asites (see above, v. 20). There was ιιο ‘magister bibendi‚’ and the guest:
drank as they pleased.

42. squillas mter nazar-aena natantes] As to ‘ squillas‚' see S. ii. 4. 58. ‘Mu-
raena ’ was a lampmy, alid accountod a great delicaey by tho Romans, who
appear to have sometimes kept them tame. They were brought chiefly fmm
the coast os Sicily. The prawns were swimming in sance, the eom ition
of which the host goes on to describe himself, as a matter of too mue cons&

uenee to be left to the explanation of his nomenclator. Tho mater-iuis wore

enafrian olive-oil (C. ii. 6. 16. n.); ‘garumss a sance made of the enunils
