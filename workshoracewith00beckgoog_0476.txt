SATIRE 111.

'rma Satine appears to have been written during the Saturnalia, in the
mouth of December, a. c.32. The year before, Agrippa had been AEdile,
and his oedileship is alluded to in v. 185. It was written at Horaee's eonn-
. try-house, not long, it may be supposed, aster it was given him. He was
improving the house at the time, as we ma infer from v. 308. The Satire
is general, taking in the leading vices and ollies of human nature,—ambi·
tion, avafice, extravaganoe, lust, superstition, which are brought together with

wghefflgp us, a man who had wasted agood fortune in speculating as
,an amateur in sorta of costly articles, particularly works os art, in which
he was held to be a connoisseur, is introduced in a new character, aa a Stoic
philosopher, reproving Horace for his laziuess, and urging him to write. He
relates the story of his own conver-sion to philosophy, which was this. When
he had lost all his fortune, and was hopelessly involved with money-leaders,
and found himself laughed at and called madman wherever he went, he grew
desperate, and was going to throw himself into the Tiher, when he was ab
tested b Stertinius, an oracle of the Stoica, who remonstrated with him and
console him, and at the same time armed him against his enemies (v. 297)
with a long homily, in the course of which he proved that all the world, but
the and wise, were as mad as he was. In this discourse he enumerates
tshe ‘ei' features of this universal madness, and this forms die bulk of the

atire. ,

of Damasippus ve little is known. But he was a real person,·though
perhaps a little before orace's da . Why Horace should have choscn this
man as the mouth-piceo of his atire does not appear. Damasippus sa
himself, it is true, that, haviu ruined his own affairs, he had nothing to o

· but to attend to the affairs o others; which Horace interprets to mean, that

he had taken to giving advice when it was not asked (see v. 27, n.).
Stertinius appears to have been an authority among the Stoice of the day.
The Scholiasta tellus he wrote 220 books on the doctrines of that school.
Damasi pus calls him (v. 290) “ sapientum octavus.” His books, if he ever
wrote em, have not rescued him from oblivion. Horace mentions him
again, in Epp. i. 12. 20, as the representative of the sect.
The diseourse of Stertinius turns upon this dogma, that every man in the
world, high or low, is mad, except the sage (see note on v. 46). Cicero has
the same doctrine of the Stoice in his Paradoxa (iii. ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρον

palu-efai), but he does not go very deep into the subject, or throw much light
upon it. · ·

2. Umbrarum pascua} Horace speaks of parchmfflt (‘ membrana ’) only
twice (A, P. 389), ‘char-ta,’ which means the Egyptian papyrus, being his
usual equivalent for a book. From the thiu eoats of the papyrus the name
- ‘liber ' was derived, and parchment was less generally used in Horace's da

than the pyrus ς though that material was also commonly employed:
‘ 'rexere artam ’ is a common expression for putting the pieces of the
‘papyrus together. ‘ Retexere scripta? therefore, means to take to pieces or
