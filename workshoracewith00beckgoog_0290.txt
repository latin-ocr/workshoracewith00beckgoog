tue, with all his learning, bath gone down once more to the grave. But so
it is: all must die alike ; some to make sport for Mars, some swallowed up
in the deep: old and young go crowding to the grave : none escape : 1, too,
have perished in the waters. But grudge me not, thou marincr, a handful
of earth: so may the stoi-m spend itself on the woods, while thou art safe,
and thv merchandise increases. Is it a small matter with thee to bring ruin
on thy* children? Yea, perhaps retribution awaits thyself: my curses will
be heard, and then no atonemcnt shall dclix-er thee. ' ris but the work of a
moment, — thrice cast earth upon me, and hasten on.

1. Te mart‘s et terrae] ‘ Te ' is emphatic, ‘ even thee: as the abruptness of
the opening requires. ἅμμον’ ετρεῖν, κύματα μετρεῖν, were proverbial ex·
pressioris for lost labor. See 'eorg. ii. 104, sqq. ε -

Quem qui scire velit, Εἰδζοί velit aequoris idem
Dicere quam multae Zep yro turbentur arenae.'‘

Archimedes wrote a work, ὁ ψαμμίτης, in which he computcd the grains of
sand on the shores of Sicily, and it may be alluded to here. There is no
reason to sup se that Archytas ever αιωωιίιεᾱ ιο solve any such problem.

on the shore under the promonotory of Matinum, running out from the range
called Mons Garganus, in Apulia. Possibly, a tomb was shown there as his.
That Arch was shipwrecked on a voyage down the Adriatic, ⁴(which is

9. Minos] Called by Hom. (od ss. xix. 149) Διὸς μεγάλου ὀαριστής,

10. Panthoiden] The story allude to is that of Pythagoras, who, to prove
his doctrine of metempsychosis, deelared that he had been Eu horbns, the son

his own a shield hung up in the temple of Juno at Argoa which, when taken

ll. quamvis] ‘⁸ Tacitus and the later writers use ⁸ quamvis ' with an indic-
afive, and, vioe versa, ‘ quanquam' with a subjunctive!⁸ (Key’s Gram. 1227,
b. note.) The prose-writers of Horaee’s time would not use ⁴ quamvis ' with
an indicative; and he uses the subjunctive where the mse is strictly hypo-
thetical, as C. iv. 2. 39, οι· where it suits the metre, asc. iv. 6. 7.
