ODE xl.

Tne swanus os impostors from the Eam, who pretended to tell fou-tunes
and cast natis-itics at Rome in the time of the empire, became a public
nuisance, and they were expelled and laws passed against them, but without
the effect of putting them down. Tacitus (Hist i. 22) describes them as
“Genus hommum infidum, sperantibus fallax, quod in civitate nostra et
vetabitur semper et mtincl›itur.'’ They were bccoming numerous in Cicero‘s
time. As might be supposed, they were most successful in engaging the
attention of women (J uv. vi. 569, q.)‚ and Horace hene addreeses himself
tu one of that sex, whom he calls uconoe, a name which appears to be
equivalent to ‘ folly!
