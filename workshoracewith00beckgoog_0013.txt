He became aequainted, among other literary persons, with Virgil
and Varius, wh0, about three years after his return (B. c. 39),
introduced him to Maecenas, who was careful of receiving into 1118
circle a tribune of Brutus, and one whose writings were of a kind
that was new and unpopular. He accordingly saw nothing of
Horace for nine months after his introduction to him. He then
sent for him (a. c. 38), and from that time continued to be his
patron and warmest friend.

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio,
and the many persons of consideration whose friendship he ap-
pears to have enjoyed. Through Maecenas, also, it is probable
Horace was introduced to Augustus; but when that happened is
uncertain. In B. c. 37, Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to
meet Μ. Antonius at Brundisium, and he took Horace with him
on that journey‚ of which a detailed account is given 111 the fifth
Satire of the first book. Horace appears to have pai-ted from the
rest of the company at Brundisium, and perhaps returned ιο
Rome by Tarentum and Venusia. (See S. i. 5, Introduction.)
Between this journey and B. c. 32, Horace received from his
friend the present of a small estate in the valley of the Digentia
(Licenza), situated about thirty-four miles from Rome, and four-
teen from Rbur, in the Sabine country. Of this property he
gives a description in his Epistle to Quintius (i. 16), and h‘e
appears to have lived there a part of every year, and to have
been fond of the place, which was very quiet and retired, being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), a muni-
cipium perhaps, but not a place of any importance. During this
interval he continued to write Satires and Epodee, but 8180, it ap- -
pears probable, some of the Odes, which some years later he
published‚ and others which he did not publish. Tbese composi·
tions, no doubt, were seen by his friends, and were pretty well
· known before any of them were collected for publication. The
first book of the Satires was published probably in B. ο. 35, the
Epodesinn.c.30,andtheseeondbook of Satireainthefollow·
