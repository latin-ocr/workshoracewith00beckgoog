place, he meansg and some commentatore, agmeing with him, have diseat-ded
this stanza as an inee- lation.

22. Nec scir-esec est C. i. ll. l.
faad diull) ‘ Sed ⁹ is commonly used after digressione to recover the tiu-ead
o t te su ‘eet.

24. mildae] That ‘ re ’ is added to some verbs without materially chang-
ing their meaning, has been shown before (C. i. 31. 12, n.).

25. quid mena] The differ-enee between ⁴ mens ' and ‘indoles ' is, that one
refers to the head, the other to what we should call the heart, the disposition.

28. Neronem] The father of Tiberius and Drusus was Tiberius Claudius
Nero, which was also the emperor's name. Drusus was Nero Claudius Dru-
sus. AThe latter was not born till three months aster his mother Livia mar-
ried tus.

29. m ematur] It is more than probable that Horace had in his mind
the words of Euripides, —-

ἐσθλῶν ἀπ’ ἀνδρῶν ἐσθλὰ γίγνεσθαι τέκνα,

κακῶν δ’ ὅμοια τῇ φύσει τῇ τοῦ πατρός (F r. Alem. 7).
‘Fortibus et bonis ’ corresponds to the common Greek expression, which it is
so difficult to render, καλοῖς κ ’ αθοῖς. These words are in the ablativo case.
Horace does not refer to the fat ier of these vouthS, who was a worthless pet-
son, but generally to their family, the Claudia gens, among whom were many
gersons of distinction. They were divided into a patric-iau and a plebeiam

ranch. To the latter belon red the Marcelli. See C. i. 12. 46, n.

337. Neronibus] Claudiusksem, who was of the family of ,which Tiberius
and Drusus came, defeated and slew Hasdrubal, when he was coming to the
hel of his brother Hannibal, Β. c. 207, on the banks of the Metaurus, a river
in gie north of Italy. Hannibal had been nearly eleven years in Ital ⁹, and
had met with few reverses, but after his brother's defeat his cause faile , and,
though he remained four years longer in Italy, it was far awa in the moun-
tains of the south, and the Romans ccased to be harassed by im. Horace,
therefore, is accurate here. ,

38. Metaurum] See A. P. 18: “ Aut flumen Rhenum.” The name is
formed into au adjective in both cases. ·

41. odorea,] ‘ Ador ' was a coarse grain, called by the Greeks ζειά, bnt the
name was applied to grain in general, and in the form ‘ adorea' signified the
supply ot: eoru given to soldiers after a victory, and henee was used as synon-

51. Sarmat· ultro] ‘We are pushing on and pursuing· those whom to
evade and to escape is our noblest triumph! There is osten some difficulty
in translating ‘ultro.’ ‘Uls' is an old pre ition involving the same root
as ⁴ ille: aud signifying ¹ on the other side o ‚' opposed to ‘ cis! ‘Ultro ’ sig·
