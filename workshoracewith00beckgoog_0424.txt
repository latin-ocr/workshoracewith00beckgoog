101. at vivan Μαικία 5] The construction is the same aa “discinctus aut
galam nepos” (Epod. i. 34 , where it has been proposed to insert ‘ut’ be-

re ‘ nepos.’ Maenius and omentanus ap ear to have been squanderers of
money, and good livere, according to the οἳ)
They are,nnited again in S. i. 8. 11, ii. 1. 21,where the former ap ars un er
the name Pantolabus, one who lays his hands on anything e can get
(πάντα λαβών), or borrows mone from any one who will lend it. He spent
his mone and turned parasite. th Maenius and Nomentanus are names
used by ucilius for characters of the same kind, and Horace may very prob-
ably have only bon-owed the names to represent some livin characters,
whom he does not ‘choose to point out by their own names, omentanus
was the name-of one of the guesoe at the dinner of Nasidienus (S. ii. 8. 25).

105. Tanain—socerumque laeua] The Senonum says that nomo has
convcyed under these names a well-known Greek proverb. What the dis-
tinction between thern may have been, is unknown.

108. nemo ut asma] ⁴ 1 return to that point from which 1 have digressed,
how that no covetous man is satisfied with himself? The reading is not cer-
tain, and the hiatus is unusual. Horace qualifles the general assei-tion he
made at the nutriet, by limiting his remark to the avaricious. See note on v,
283 and on ‘ laudet,’ sec v. 3.

114. Ut, carceribus] These lines arc a little like the last three verses
of Virgil’s t Georgic.

119. Cedat uriconium suam] These are so like the words of Lucretius
(ἢ 951), that perhaps Horace remembered thern when he wrote, —

“ Cur non ut plenus vitae conviva recedis,
Aequo anim ne ca is securam, stulte, quietem ’Β ”

120. crispina· scrinia lo‘pffi e know nothing about Crispinus. The fer-
tility of his pen has profited him nothing. He was more anxious to write
much than to write well. See S. i. 4. 14, s q. Crispinus appears in the
third Satire of this book (v. 1³9), where he is t c only attendant of the would-
be ‘rexl He appears again in S. ii. 7. 45. ‘Lippi' is used for mental
blindness. -

SATIBE 11.

Tms satire, the coarsest of all written by Horace, seems tc have been sug-
gested by the death of Tigellius, a celebrated musician of the time. It is
directed against the tendency of men to run into extremes, and to pass from
one extreme to the other. Illustrations of niis subject are drawn from the
social life of Rome. The ideas and the lauguage are marked by a grossness
which is unusual with Horace.
