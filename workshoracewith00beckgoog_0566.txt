(Milan). He was a slave, but afterwards received his freedom. He died
B. c. 168, the year aster Ennius. His contemporaries held him in high estimaf
tion. Cicero places him at the head of the comic poets, but speaks ill of his
Latin. What is meant by ‘gravitate ' is as uncertain as ‘properare' in the
verse before, and for the same reason.

Terentius arta] The exact sense in which Horace meant this word is
equally uncertain with the others; perhaps it has reference to the· elegance
ο Tcrence's language‚ or the skill with which he drawa real life in his plays.
There are few like him now. His name was Ρ. Terentius Afer. He was a
slave in the famil of one Ρ. Terentius Lucanus, whose praenomen and gen-
tile name he too , on his manumission, retaining as a co omen the name
which he derived from the place of his birth, Carthage. he plays we have

60. arcto είίραεα theano] The pla s of Terence and all the earlier and
more-celebrated poets were rform ‚ at first, either on scaffoldings crected
in the Circus, and afterwa s taken down, or in tempor-ary wooden theatres,
usually on a very large scale ; the notion being that a systematie encourage-
ment of lays, by the erection of permanent buildin S, was injurious to ub- .
>lic mo s. The first permanent stone theatre at ome (for they hadt em
in the country towns some time before) was built by Cn. Pompeius, after the
Mithridatio war, outside the walls, near the Campus Martiae.

62. Lim· scriptoris ab aete] T. Livius Andronicus is spoken of by Quin·
tilian as the first Roman poet. The date of his birth is uncertain, but he
died n. c. 221, or thereabouts. He wrote a translation of the od sse , and

lays. These were all, as far as we know, ‘palliatae,' from e reek.
gicero says they were not worth a second reading.

66. dm— “ nave] The first resents the hamhness of the style, the
second its care cssness. Compare . Ρ. 445. ‘Jove aequo ’ is the opposite
of ‘Jove non probante' (C. i. 219 .

70. playoeum milei parvo Orbilium ἰσων-ε ,·] Orbilius Pupillus was a native
of Beneventum. In his fiftieth year (n. c. 63) he came to Rome and set up
a school. He seems to have held the rod as the principle of school govern-
ment. He lived in great ‘poverty‚ in a fret, to nearly a hundred years of

went to his school. As to ‘dictare,' see S. i. 10. 75,.n.

dies S‘togatae Ἰ, o w ich a few fragments remain. He died n. ο. 78. It is
not e ear that Horace had any particular play in mind, but it may have been
an affectation of Atta's to have flowcrs scattered on the stage, on which it
was usual to s rinkle a perfume extracted from the crocus. The per-sume
was mixed witlli³ water and thrown u through ipes, so as to sprinkle not
only the stage, bnt the spectatore. he most mous crocus, was that of
Mount Corycus, in Cilicia see S. ii. 4. 68, n.).
