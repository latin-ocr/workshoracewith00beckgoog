EPISTLE XIII.

Tms letter professes to be written by Horace to one Vinius Asella, the
beami- of certain volumes of his to Angustus at Rome, Horace being probably
at his own estate. He writes as if he had given his friend particular and
anxious instructions, when he started, as to how he was to behave, aud as if
this was to be sent after him, to over-take him on the road, in order to impress
those instructions upon his memory. It is probable that some such jokes

liable to make mistakes in the execution of bis mission; to intrude at an
nnseasonable time; in the eagerncss of his affection for Horace, to be too
officious; to carry the books awkwardly, so as to draw attention, or to stop
in the streets in order to tell his curione friends what important business he
was upon. The person addressed is called Vinius, and the allusion in v. 8
lenda to the inference· that his cognomen was Asellus, or Asina, or Asella,
which belonged to different Roman families. , ·
