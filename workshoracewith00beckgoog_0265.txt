ODE IV.

L. Snswms, whose nume is used in this Ode, was one of those who ser-ved
with Horace under Brutus, and thev were no doubt on ter-ms of intimacy.
The Ode professes to be written at the beginning of spring, und its subject
is the uncertainty os life and the duty of enjoying it.

Anouunn'r.—- The winter is nimium the spring is remminffl the ships
are being luunche‹1; the hcrds quit their stalis and the ploughman his tire-
sidc ; und the meadows ure no long-cr white with frost. Venus und the
Graeca ure leading the (lance, und the Cyclops’ forge is bnrning. Let ns bind
the head with myrtle or the earth’s first flowers, and sacrifice a lumb or kid
to Puu. Dcath calls on rich and poor alike. Life is short, O Sestius! and.
our ho s we must contruct. 'rho grave nwuits thee; and when them, no
more thou preside ut the feast, or sigh for the fair young Lycida.
