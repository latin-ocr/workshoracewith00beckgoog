of slander in respect to his pemeual character, which Horace here warini!
defends, but which in-after ‚vem was much blackened. There neema to he
no other way of accounting for the earnestness with which Horace declares
his friend's innocence of the vice of avarice, for instance, than to suppose
that fault had been laid to his charge, as it was so freely aster his death (see

1 33. atrleere)lio.·o'das] The lural ‘oblirIones ’ is nowhere else used. ‘ Car-
pere ' is used in the sense o gradually consuming, and llas something like
that meaning here. ‘Lividus' is akin to the Greek πελιδνός, aad to the
Latin ‘luridus’ (C. iii. 4. 74, n.). lt means ‘dark,' aad is commonly as-
sociated with envy, which connects it with oblivion caused by envy. Hor-aee
says ‹lark oblivion shall not swallow up the labors os Lollius with impunity;
as islllm were his champion, ready to defend him against the attacks of obliv-

34. Est ‹un'mns tibi] ‘Rerum prudentia’ is a knowledge of the world.
“Cato multarum rerum usum habebat'' (Cic. de Am. ii. 6) expresses the
same kind of expericnce. ⁸ Rectus' means ‘erect,’ not stoopin or bow-ed
down, as “Fana deos habuere rectos '⁹ (C. iv. 4. 48). See a so Ennius,

39. Consnlque non um’us anni] Compare C. iii. 2. 19. Lollius was consul,
n. c. 21, but Horace says that an upright ‘judex ' is always on a level with
the highest magistrate-x and such ever was Lollius, besieged like others with
temptations to corruption, but resisting them all, and so overcoming the
elne-mica¹ who encompazsed him, and delivering himself by his virtue stom

41. ιῙιιιίω· hernestum] That it should be a matter of great merit and diffi-
culty to maintain the character of an uncorrupt judex, does not say much
for the honesty of those who exerciscd the fonctions of jun-om. The corrup-
tion os the senatorian body led to the judicial power being transferred fmm
them to the equite-⁸, but they in their turn were found so corrupt that it was
ἂνω back to the senatores, and afterwards the Judices were selected from

th orders. See S. i. 4. 123, n.

‘⁸ Codrus pro patria non timidus mori.” See also C. iii. 2. 13, n.

 

ODE X.

onttmxcs is a merely poetical ἰξτεοῐιααο, and probably Horace com·
posed this Ode with a Greek original sore him or in his mind.

Anonmssxr.——Cruel and lovels· boy; when the down shall have saed
upon thr chcek‚ and thy flowing locks have fallen, and thy soft mmp cxion
vanished, thou shalt look in the alass, and say, “ why did 1 not, as a bov,
