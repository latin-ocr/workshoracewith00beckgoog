136. ut arreptor cyclicus olim .- class of pic poete amne some time after
Homer, who, perhaps from the habit of reeiting as rhapsodints the Iliad and
Odyssey‚ were led to adopting subjecte akin to Homer’s, and connecting their

poema with his; and their design appearing to have been to form their poema
and Homer’s into one c cle, embraeing the whole history of the Trojan times,

they came to be called y the grammarians Cyclic poete. of these the oldest
was Arctinus of Miletus, whose poem was a continuation of the Iliad, and

nearly as long. One of them, Leaehee, a Lesbian contemporary with Archi-
lochus, wrote a poem known aa the Μικρὰ Ἴλιός. It opened with these two
lines, which Horace may or may not have had iu mind :

Ἴλιον ἀείδω καὶ Δαρδανίην εὔπωλον,
ἧς πέρι πολλὰ ὁτάθον Δαναοὶ θεράποντες Ἀρηος. ἡ
