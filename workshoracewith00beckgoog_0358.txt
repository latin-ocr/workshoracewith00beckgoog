1. O naza mettum] Horace was born n. c. 65, when L. Manlius Torquatus
and L. Aurelius Cotta were consuls, in which year the amphora addrcascd is
here said to have been filled. (see above, C. iii. 8. 12, u.) ⁴ Testa,' which
significa properly any earthen vessel, was used to express the ‘dolium ¹ aa
well as the ⁴ amphora.¹ Here it means the latter. In Epod. xiii. 6, Horace
had before referred to this wine. The force of the epithet ⁴ pia¹ is more easily
felt than rendered. ⁴ Gentle ¹ ia Francis's translauon, and 1 know no better,
for the meaning ia to be derived from its emnection with ⁴ facilem somnum!

5. Quocunque—nomine ‘on whatever account! ‘⁴ Nomen ¹ signifies an
2¹¹5& {23⁰5 &ffufiffiknssf '=‚}⁰c⁵e'10'.¹ 1¹12, Α’Ῑιέοοῗιὲἓῖυῗ ffffieifgssfissffi
est hoc vitium notandum‚¹¹ i. e. on man accounts, or in many particulare.
‘Lectum ¹ applica to the gutheriug of e gra from which the wine was
made. The word ⁴ descende ¹ is used because »e apotheca was in the uppcr
part ofthe house. (See above, C. iii. 8. 11, 11.) For the same cauae ‘deripe ¹
111 used (C. iii. 28. 7). ⁴ Dignus ¹ is used sometimes by the later prose-writers
with an infinitivo. In Iloraee'a day and b Cicero it was used only with tho
relative pronoun in construction thh a ver . ⁴ Languidiora ¹ cot-responde to
⁴ languescit mihi ¹ above (C. iii. 16. 36).

9. undet] ‘is steeped in.¹ This word would hardly have been used for
⁴ imbuitur ¹ iu this sense on any other occasion.

11. Narratur et prisci ΟαεοηἺ This is the Cato mentioned ou C. ii. 15. 11.
ms being fond os wine is most ikel an invention of Horace¹s.

13. Tu tate tormentum inymio] ⁴ {hou applicet a gentle spur to the usually
ung-enial temper.¹ ⁴ Dum ingenio ¹ means the rescrvcd temper whose sym·
pathies and purpoaes are not easily drawn out, as in Terence (Phorm. iix. 2.
12), “Adeon¹ iu nio esse duro te atque inexombili.'’

14. sapientium This applica to the philosophical and thoughtful (as ‘sapi-
entia ¹ is ut for philosoph , C. i. 34. 2), who have little to do with mirth till
they are rought out o t emselvcs by cheerful com anv. 1t is said that in
his Odea Horace always uses the termination ⁴ inm ¹ or the genitive plural of
noune ending in ‘ens,' and for participles the terminatiou ⁴ tum.¹ But the
instances os either are not numerous enough to determine a rule, aud the so-
called nouus are usually participles, as ⁴ sapiens “ ia.

18. mua] That ia, strength and confidence‚ os which horus were the
symbol. See C. ii. 19. 30, n.

19. Post tel ⁴⁴ Quis post vina gravem militiam aut pauperiem crepat‘!”
(C. i. 18. 5.) As to ‘apicesl sce C. i. 34. 14.

21. Te Liber] He says, ⁴ Thoe, Liber, and Venus (if she will be cheerful
and come), and the Graece slow to loose the hond that binde them, aud the
buming lum , shall protract even until Phoebus on his return puts the stara
to ssight! e meaning is, the wine shall go round and the lamps shall
burn, with jollity aud love ( women commonly were os the company on these
occasions) and good humor for our compnnions, till suurise.

22. squ-aqum nodvaem adver-el ⁴ unwilling to be separated! Aa Horace rep·
resenta the Graece naked, or with loose mbcs (C. i. 30. 5, 11.), ‘nodum ¹ can·
not aignnify the zone, ns some commentatom sav. It seems to mean the hond
that anites them. They nne usually monped with their arma iutertwined.
Here thev Υθβωωῐιι good humor, aa opposed to 111-1111111113.
