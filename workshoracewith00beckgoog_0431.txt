SATIRE IV.

Htu again Horace is at pains to defend himself from the charge of malev-
olcnee. This charge, no doubt, was loudly brought against him by thou
who were or thought themselves the objecta of his satum and he atu-ibam
it, us well us the neglect his poema experieneed compared with the inferior

1. Eupolis atque Omina-s Aristophaneupoe] He begins by describing the
character os Lucilius us a saniz-ist, and says he followed in the steps of the old
Greek comediuus. The Greek eomedy was divide-d by the Alexandrino
gnunmuriuns into three periods, the Old, the Middle, and the Now. The
three ›cmons here named wenc the chief pocus of the Old Comed . Cratinus
was tte eldest of the three, und died n. c. 422, when Aristoph es πω ι

law of Athens did not interfere with the poet's iberty of smch, except upon
two occasions, when psephisms were passed prohibiting the introduction upon
the stage of living characters ns objects os satire by name, — a roan-iction of
no great fon-e, since the substitution of a feigned name, slightly altered fmm
the true, would make the allusions equally intelligihle and more ridiculous.
