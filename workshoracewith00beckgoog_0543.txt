locrus, to whom this Ε 'stle is adamantias 1000 mentioned, avith alt
thatin known oi him, in t e Introduction to C. i. 29, aud Pom ius Gros-
phus in C. ii. 16. It ia alectoros introductiou ior Grosphus to ecius, who
. was employed iu managiug Agrippa's estates in Sicily. The Epistle begins
with seme general remarks on the position and circumstances 01 locius, ax·
herting him to contentment, and oommending bis parauit of philosophy in
the midst oi common employmeuts. It theu passas on to tha recommenda—

tion oi Grosphus, and finishes with oue or two atoma oi public nem.

1. Fructibus Agrippae] From what sources A ‘ppa derived his immense
wealth we do not know. From this Epistls wo earn that be had autea iu
Sicily, probably given him aiter his suceessea agnina Sextus Pompeius. Her·
aco means to say to locius, that he has got a good post, aad mav be

comiortable ii he is carciul, He probably geta pereantaga on whaths ·
lcctcd. He collected Agrippa's ravin, ‘fructas'
4. cai reram sa petit 000] ‘Rerum usus' bere seems to mean thesnppl ·
os things needsus ‘suppeto' meaning ‘to be sufficicnt,' occurs in Ep .
, xvii. 64. ‘Pauper’ishere used more in tha sense oi privation than Heraea
nerallvusesit.

· gel. positorum] ‘Ponere' is tlra muni werd fer parting dishas on the table,
as obscrvcd on S. ii. 2. 2³. Here tine dislics ate meant, aa we can tcll by the
context. The nettle, ‘urtica' sonna an ingredtem in tho broth of poor pdople
in this country, and still mere in Scotland. ‘Protinus’ means ‘right on,'
and is applied iu various ways. Here it means ‘in an unintennptcd·course,’
that is, ‘always' ‘Ut’ means ‘even snppesing,'asiu Epod. i. 21. ‘Cou-
lestim,' ‘straigbtvvay,' bas tbe sams root as ‘festino' ‘Fortunae rivus'
scenis, as Orelli says, to have boen a proverbial expression. .

hio. ulfilanam 001ιί00] Horace says the same in adifferent applicatiou else·
w erc ⁴ .iv.5 :
( ΡΜ ⁴⁴ Licet superbas ambules pecunia,
Fortuna non mutat genus.''

12. hfirnmar si Denwcriti] “I am su rised tbat Democritus should hare
allowed bis sheep to eat the coru off his elds, while his mind was wandcri
in svviit llight iar away, leaving his body; aud yet you, in tbe midst oi ru
sordid work and the iniection of money, are bcnt on vvisdom, and that of uo
mcan sort, and continue to studv things sublime.'' Democritus ei Abdera
had a considerable patrimony, which ba ueglaetcd ior traval aud study. It
seems his nutne had passed into a rovcrb.

20. Empedocles an Siminina] m ecles was born about Β. 0. 520, and
nris a manos wealth and station at ' utum iu Sicily. He was a phi·
losopher, but his opinions are hard to traca He pretended to a divine natum.
(See A. Ρ. 463, q.) His ms, oi which fragments are extant, were much
*read and adrnirdd by the ornans. Ilorace refers rhaps to a dogma im-
putcd te Empedocles, to which Cicero alludcs (Dc dietrici vii.) when he says
“Agrigentinum quidem (loetum quendam virum carminibus Graccis vatici·
netum icrunt, quae in rernm natura totoque mundo constarent quacapue mo·
verentur, ea contrahere amicitiam, dissipare (1000011000.υ
