nomen, meaning to write on the praises of the country, put his poem into
the shape of a rhapsody by a money-gettin usurer, who, after recitin the
blessings os a country life, und sigliing sor e enjoyment of thern, reso ving
ω throw up his business, and persuading himself that he desines nothing so
much as retirement and a humble life, finds habit too strong for him, und
falls back upon the sordid pursuits which, after all, are most con nial to

shade or on the soft gmss, uthere birds nre singing and streams ate murmur·
ing; or hunts the boat, or lays nets sor the. birds and hanes, and hcrein forgets
the ngs of love. Give me a chaste wife, who shall care sor my home and
chil ren, milk my gome, prepare m nnbonnht menl, and no dainties shall

leuse me like my country fare, as sit and watch the ltine and oxen and
faborem coming home to their rest at even-'⁹ So said Alphius the neuter,

and, determining to live in the country, he got in all his money, hut soon re·
pented, and put it out to usury again.
