ODE XXIV.

Qomc'nmne VAnoe was born at Cremona, and was a neighbor and friend
of Vir-gil, through whom it is probablc Horace made his acquaintance. He

¹He difflyoffunghn. c. 24, and this Ode is intended to console Virgil for the

Aeculanum—What bounds shall be set to our grief for one so ear?
Tcach us a mournful strain, Melpomene. Can it be that Quinctiliu3‚ *hose
like Modesty‚ J astice, Fidelity, and Truth shall not behold again, is gone to
his ever-lasting rest? Many good men mour-n for him, but none more truly
than thou, Virgil. ’T was not for this thou didst commit him to the care of

the same way as Horace uses ⁴ quodsi‚' ‘but is.'

15. imaqa'ni,] ‘Imago’ (‘spectre,’ ‘shade') was that unsubstantial body
in which the soul was supposed to dwell after death, called by the Greeks
