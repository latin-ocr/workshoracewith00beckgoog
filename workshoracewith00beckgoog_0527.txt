second time n. c. 26. The age of e wine was usually uooed by the consul-
ship in which it was bottlcd. See C. iii. 8. 12, u.‚ and as to ‘diffusa,’ see
C. xv, 5. 34, ιι, and S. ii. 2. 58. As to Minturnae and Sinuessa, see S. i. 5.
40, ιι. Petrinus was a hill orerhanging Sinuessa, or a tract of land in its
neighborhood. The overflow'ings of the Garigliano (Liris), on which Mintur·
nae stood, still render the surrounding country damp, and it is v thinly
inhabitcd. The Falernus r and Mons Massicus, with their ce ebrated
vineyards, were in the neigffirhood of Sinuessa. It does not appear that
Horaee's wine was of the best, but two vineyards close to each other may
produce wines of very different quality.

does not mean tint the tire was bnnnng, bnt that the ‘focus,' b which he
means that which stood in the Atrium, near the images of the , and
which was probably of bronze, had been burnished and made gay for the oe-

famous rhetorieian of Pergamum, who was charged with the crime of poison-
ing, and his cause was undet-taken by Torquatus, aud also by Asinius Pollio
(“ insigne maestis praesidium reis‚'’ C. ii. 1. 13).

σιω meo Caesare] See Introduction. It happened that the 23d of Septem-
ber, Augustus’s birthday, was one of those datvs in which the early part was
‘ nefastus ’ς that is, the praetor could not hold his court till a later hour than
usual. Hence it is marked in the Calendar N. Ρ. (‘Nefastus Prior '). So
that it was doubly a holidny for TorquatnS, and he eould lie in bed without
damaging his cause, and therefore might sit up late with his friend.

11. Aoetimm] This word does not accurately apply, for the summer

uses ‘assidet' to signify resemblance. It is not so used elsewhere. The
guests not unc-ommonly wore wreaths of flowers on their heads, and carried
them in their hands ; and we can understand their scattering them about the
table and floor, especially when they were merrv. But it appears that the
slaves scattered flowers about, for the sake of their pei-sume. Horace says ε
“Pareentes ego dexteras Qui: sparge rosas'' (G. iii. 19. 21). OE'msh nowen
