20. Proteneibus optimasunyis] e says the ⁸ fungi ' that grew in the open
meadows were more to be trusted than others, —that is, those which grew iu
the shade. Truffles and different kinds of mushrooms were much eaten by
the Romans, as they are still by the Italians. of the latter there were and
are varieties. The mushroom most highly esteemed was the boletus,
whie was cultivated in gai-dens, and kept for the eating of the rich. But all
such fug-gi had to be chosen with great care. Even the boletus sex-ved to
carry o an em ror.

24. Au ius This may be M. Aufidius, who was remarkable as havin
been the t at Rome who bred and fattened peaeocks for sale, and derive
a large profit (as much as 600,ooo sesterces a year) from that trude. As to
the eom sitiou of ‘mulsum,’ see note on S. ii. 2. 15, n. Falernian wine,
which orace appears to have esteemed next to Caecuban, is here called
‘fornax and'elsewhere ‘severum’ and ‘uniens' (C. i. 27. 9; ii. 11. 19). It
wath a very strong spirituous wine, and required long keeping to become
mc ow. .

27 . mor-abitur] This mav have been a medical word for custiveness. ‘ Mi-
tulus,' the limpet‚ was an 'inferior sort of eheu-fish. The Greeks called it
πλλίνη or ξιφὺδριον. Tho ‘lapathus’ is mentioned above as a purgative
(Epod. ii. 57, ιι.). ‘ Brevis’ rcfcrs to the size of the plant.

30. Lubrica nascentes inqdeut] T hat §hell-{ish were best at the time of tho
new moon, appears to have been nerally believed among the ant-iente.
They had many fancies respecting e influenee of the moon on various ob-
jecta, in which, however, modern ignor-unce nnd superstition have perhaps

32. yMwioe Baiano] This alien-fietu, from which a purple dye was obtained,
was found, it seems, in at abundance at Baiae. It would seem not to have
been as usesul sor the ta le as forits dyo. The ‘ peloris,’ which was found in
the Lacus Lucrinus, close to Baiae, appears to have been an insipid fish,
though Catius says it is better than tho murex. The rival oyster-beds were
in the Lacus Lucrinus and at Circeii, the opposite point of the bay which is
teminated by the romontory of that name, in Latium, and the promontory
of Misenum, in ampania. Catius gives the preference to the oysters of
Circeii, which Pliny also says were unsurpaesed (xxxii. 21). See note on
E . ii. 49. The best oysterS, however, were found a't Brundisium on the
ot er coast, whence the spawn was ean-ied to stoek the beds ou the coast
os cam ania and Latium.

34. ecti'm‘bua patulis] · The eheu-fieb called ‘pectem' it seems, was found
iu greatest rfection at Tarentum. From the epithet ⁴ patulis ’ it must have
been one o the bivalved sort.

molle Tarentum] The dcssenerate character os the Tui-cntines, which gained
their city the epitheta ‘ molle,' ‘imbelle ’ (Ep . i. 7 . 45), dates from the death
of Archytas, about the middle of the fourt century Β. c. Among other
