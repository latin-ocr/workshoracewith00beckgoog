³⁸. sapaudia ἲ] It is possible this ma menn ‘oei-vioe: which is its
military sense; or it ma be ‘ penalty,' butt e meaning is doubtful. ‘ Quae
finis' means ⁴ what death? ' Captives led in triumph were always put to
death. See C. iv. 2. 35, ιι.

40. mark] ‘Sono’ is used as an active verb only by the poeta, aster
the manner of ἠχεῖν. The satire of what follows is vergamusing. In his
plea for fo iveness he repente his offence, implying that to call her chasoe he
must lie. vffiich, however, he is willing to do. The following words are the
substance of what he promises to say in her raisc, placing her, like Ariadne
and other virtuous women, among the consue atione.

42. Infamia Helenae The story is, that Stesichorus C. iv. 9. 8, n.) was

struck with blindness {lor writing a libel on Helen, aud on writing a re-

cantation (παλ la) he was restored to sight by Helen, or, as Horace here
eeaezxxzpzffiffixz :zezemmmwfflerm
used χάριν and ‘⁵ iu the same way.

45. potes nam, his is a common formula in entreaties both in Greek
(διὀνᾳ γάρ) and Latin.

46. Ο nec palemis] ‘ Ο thou who art not dehnsed by the sins of thy
parents, who art not an old witch skilled in sprinkling ou the ninth day the .
ashes on the tombs of the r.’ In this way, while he pretends to recum, h·
makes his la ge more ibellous than ever.

wuda] ” is applied in an unusual sense. It usually signifles that
which is e to deeay (out os use), as clothes, housea, faded plemres, ἀο.
(see For-0513, and so it eomes to mean generally that which is spoils und
worthless, as here. See C. ii. lo. 6.

48. Novendiales] It appears, if we ure to believe the old commentatore,
to have hoen the practice to burv the ashes nine days aster death. Theresore,
Horace means to exuthat the witch dug up the ashes of the dead immediately
amr their burial, ⁸ e they were fresh, and better suited on that account for
magical ceremonies. The ashes os the poor are fixed upon, perhaps, because
they were not waoehed as the rich man’s were. ‘ Novendiales ’ usually signi-.
fies ‘ of nine days' continuant-ef but it cannot have that meaning here.
Hector was buried after nine days (Il. xxiv. 784).

50. Thaso-eventa· Pactumeiu-sd ln Epod v. 5 it is i ⁰ uated that Canidia
'n childless, that the children she pretends to have are no hers, and her child-
births are a fiction, perhaps to exn-act money from her lovers, on whom her

pmended children were affiliated. Here the libel is withdrawn, but in such ·

Roman name; why Horace uses it, no one can tell. There is some allusion
that would have been intelligible at the time.

The festival in honor of Cotys or Cotytto was of hraeian origin, and nans-
