tormer da ε, and is led to refer to them, because this wan the chief subject
οἲὲἓυνήέυἱᾘαῖὶιίε may mean either the chariot (formed from ‘ curro,' as
⁴ vehiculum’ rom ⁴ veho ) or the course.

4. cblleyine] The perfect is used to express the frequent re tition of the
action, like the Greek aorist. The best illustration of what fol ows is in the
Iliad (xxiii. 338, sqq.). ‘Meta' was the conical pillar at the end of the
course mund which the chariots turned on their way back to the staning-

lace. By the Greeks it was called νῦσση. It was the mark of a skilsul
{river to turn the goal as closely as possible without touchiug it, which is
implied in ‘ fervidis Eritata rotis.'

6. Terrarum donzinos] That 13, the Romans. Virgil (Aen. i. 282) calls
them ‘⁸ Romanos rerum domiuoS.”

8. wyeminia] This refers to the three curule magistr-acies, those of the
aedile, praetor, and consul. Though the quoestorship was usually the first
step in the line of promotion, itis not included, because it was not a curule
office. ¹ Tergeminus ’ here signities no more than ‘ triplex! ‘ Geminus ' is
used in this combination with cardinal numbers frequently. So virgil ·
(Aen. vi. 287) calls Briarcus ‘ centumgeminus) ‘ Honoribus is the ablatis-e
ease, as (C. i. 21. 9) ε “ Vos Tempe totidem tollite laudibus.'' Tac. Ann. i. 3:
“ Claudium Marcellum pontificatu et curuli aedilitato— M. Agrippam genii·
natis consulatibus extulit.”

Cenat —tollerel The poets, following the Greek idiom, use sor conven-
ience and conciseness this construction of the intinitive with verbs, which in
prose would require ‘ ut. ’ with the subjunctive, or a su ine, or ⁴ ad ' with a
&effudi grhsome other elonstruction. Iar: 1ζὲ tillem ἓὲἰέ we arte ‘⁸ egit viiscoe” ;

verbs of all kinds siguisying desire and the reverse are iprgqucntly used with .
the ''ifinitivffi as in this Ode : “ demere spernit,'' ‘⁴ refugit tcndere ” ; C. 9.
13, ‘ fuge quaerere,¹’ 810. Propertius uses the infinitive after ‘ire‚' which
the prose writers never do τ “Ibat ct hirsutas ille videre seras '' (i. 1. 12).

10. de Libycis verritur arcia] The great mass of the corn consumed at
Rome was imported from Sicily and Libya. See C. iii. 16. 26, 31. S. ii. 3.
87. The ‘ area ' was a raised floor on which the corn was threshcd; and,
after the wind had winnowed it, the floor was swept‚ and the corn was thus
eofficted. See virgil (Georg. i. 178, sqq.), where directions are given for
m n an ‘ area!

11. ῗίηάεκ sarculo] There is something of contempt in these words, where
we should have expected ‘ami-e! The soil must be poor that was worked
by a hoe, and the owner ‘ macro auper agello! (Epp. ii. 2. 12.) ‘ Scin-
dere' is the proper-word for the p ough; ‘findere,' sor the 1100 or lesser in-
struments. — ‘ Attalicis conditionibus ’ signitics ¹ the most extravagant terms.⁹
There were three kings of Pergamus of this name, which was proverbial for
riebes, The third left his great wealth to the Romans (n.c. 134). Sec C. ii.
18. 5. Compare for ‘ conditionibus ’ Cic. ad Qu. Fr. i. 2. 8 : ‘⁸ Nulla conditio
pecuniae te ab summa integritate deduxerit.''

13. (11111000ωῆ From the meaning of ‘dc‚’ ‘down from,’ ‘demoveo' is
more properly used when the place from which the removal takes place is
expressed‚ and ‘ dimoveo ⁹ when the sentence is absolute, as here. For in-
stance, ‘ demovet ’ is the ropcr reading in C. iv. 5. 14 ι “ Curvo nec facicm
littore demovet.” The Elss. have in many instant-es ‘ dimovet ' whcre
‘ demovet ' is wanted. The same remark applies to ‘ diripio ’ and ‘ deripio ⁹
— ‘ Cypria) ‘ Myrtoum‚' ‘ Icariis ’ (C. iii. 7. 21), ’ Africum,' are all particular
names sor general, as ‘ Bithyna carina ' (C. i. 35. 7). By adding names more
