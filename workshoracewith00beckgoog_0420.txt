SAT RE 1.

Tan· professed nrpose of this Satira, or that with which Horace seems to
have begun, ms. thered from the first two lines. Discontent with the
condition that vi enee had assigned them ; disappointment with the po-
sition many years’ labor, nnd perhaps dishonesty, have gained them ς envy of
their neighbors’ circumstances, even if they be worse than their own; dis·
satisfaction, in short, with what they have and are, and eraving for something

· they have not and are not, —thcse are features common to the great majority

osmen. For this vice os disconvent the Gneeks had a comprehensive name,

μεμψιμοιρία. It will be soen that, after propoundi the whole subject in
the shape of s. question to Maecenas, Horace confines imsels to one solution
of it, and that notthe most comprehensive (see notes on vv. 28. 108). Avarico
is the onl reason he assigns for the universal discsse, and any one will see
that here y he leaves many untouched who are as culpably restless as the
avariciouS, but not in their sordid way.

The Satire is put first in the order of this book, not as an introduction (of
which it bears no signs), but because it is addressed ω Maecenas.

l. quam sibi mem] Sec note on C. i. 9.14, ns to ‘sors' and ’ἴοι-ι’

These two are opposed, as effect and cause, the condition and that which
reduces it. ‘Fors ’ and ‘ratio ’ ere opposed as that which a. man cannot

Eslpghand that which he curves out for himself. ‘ Fors ’ is ‘ accident: ‘ ratio '
ιε ‘ mee.

3. laudet] This sense of ‘laudam’ ‘felicem pmedicnress μακαρίζειν, is
repeated below, v. 9, sud in v. 109, where it occurs in combinanon with,
und ns equivalent to, ‘ probare? So Cicero (De Am. c. 7) says: “Ex quo
iuomm beata mors videtur, horum vita. laudabilis.”

laudet dinosa sequentes? This is briefly expiessed, for ‘ sed quisque
landet) In the transition rom negative to positive stamineum, the positive
clement which is contained in the former is often carried on in the mind, so
as to effect the latter, as in those sentences which are coupled by ‘ nec ’ and
‘ct,’ οὔτε and τε. ‘ Nemo vivit’ is ‘ quisque non vivit! ‘Diversa’ indi·
entes, not merely different, but ‘ opposite ’ careers.

4. ⁸qram‘s annis Virffil says (Aen. ix. 246): “Hic annis gmvis atque ⁴

animi maturus etes! And ‘ gravis ¹ is one of the communest words
applied to old age, ss may be gether-ed from Cicero's matisc De Senect.;
and βαρύς is equally common in the same connection. Horace, in his own
{lempaigninffi had undoubtedly heard many s veteram grumbling st his con-

tion.

7. Quid enim, concur-titur .·] See C. ii. 18. 23, n.

horae Memmio] ‘ Horae momento ’ is a common phrase in Livy and
other writers. Horace hes below, ‘ puncto ”¹9¹³ssss horne! ‘ Punctum' is
