Tarra Satire is an easay on pond living, pnt in the form of preeapta deliv-
ered to Horace at second hand by one Catius, who professes to hare received
tircm hom some suge more learned in the art, whom he does not nune.
Horace meets bim accidentally, as he is hurr'piag awap from the Professor’e
lecture, to think over what he had leamt, an to storo rt in bis mind. Catius
recites what ha has heard, from memory or from notes, and enters rithmi
prelnce upon the question of the fitst eonrso. Tho Professor may he sup-
posed to bave carried his hearers throu han entire diener, ‘¹ ab oro mque
ad mala'’ (seo S. i. ³. t, nl. Catius ondy givos the heads of the lecture aad
one o'r two of tho sage's reflectione. The precepta bo delivors inflame Hor·
ace with a desire to seo and bear the great man himself, aad he prays Catius
to introduce him. It mav be that Horace bad sorno third person in bb eye,
but we have no means ofltnowing who it wne. It it be so, there were mose,
no doubt, who would understand tho allusion at the time. Aa to tlte man
Catina himself, he appears to bave been a well-known follower of the Epicn-
rean school, bnt he must have herm dead many years before this Sat-ire ns
written. Probably, therefore, Horace only introduces his nameus shmdta
for ridiculing the Epicureans.
