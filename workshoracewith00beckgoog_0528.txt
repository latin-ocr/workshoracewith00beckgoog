15. patiarque vel incon-§deus haberi] See C. ii. 7. 28 ; 111. 19. 18.

18. Quid non ebrietas dese* 9] ‘Designat’ is to do anything 0111 of the
way, as iu Terence (Adelp . i. 2. 6): u s

Omitto: modo quid designavifffletsstaQffltritmm id est‘!

De. Fores effregit atquo 111 aedes irruit.”
Horace says, ‘ What strange things will not ebrie do ’ἐ ’ As to ⁸ operta re·
cludit,' compare C. i. 18. 163 iii. 21. 16; Ε . 11. 14; and the places
quoted in the note 011 S. i. 4. 87.
· 18. addocet artem] That is, more ραι-1101110119, 1110 art of speech mentioned
111 1110 next line. ‘Addocet' is an uncornmon word, and 10 111ιο 1110 Greek
προσδιδάσκει. ‘ Fecundi calices’ am full cups. ‘ Contracta paupertas ¹
corresponds ω ‘ angustam pauperiem ⁹ (C. iii. 2. 1).

21. Haec eqo procurare] The ‘ procurator ’ was one of the chief slaves
and neral steward. But 1110 ‘pnomus’ was also called ‘procurator poni3
(see . ii. 2. 16), and Horace says 110 has undertakcn or ordered himself to
mange everything for 1110 dinner. ‘Hace ’ refers to what follows. He says
he is ⁴ idoneus,' competent to 1110 duty, and ‘ non invitus,' he likes it. ‘ ltn-
peror ' is nowhere else used as it is here. The pro r construction is ‘ impo-
ratur mihi? So Horace alone uses ‘invideor ( . P. 56). As to ‘toral’
and ‘mappa,' see· S. ii. 4. 81. 84. ‘Corruget nares' means to make the
guggtsetlunrgnffl cneii-hanff :tlt dgffiuvsvtgrd for ‘to turn ont of doorsss· Horace
³523ss- ’ἑὲἓιῖἰ »Ἓεὶΐῖἕ ὶῖιὲἓῖἱέ 1.οὲ '1123ss 1;.1“..ἳῖῗ.“11;,“ξιεὲ.ἳ.’ὲ»;“ᾱξῖἕὲἒ·

28. locus est et pluribus umbris ι] Horace says there is room for several
‘umbrae' (S. ii. 8. 22, 11.), that is, four; for a run ‘triclinium’ held nine
persons. But, considering the beat of 1110 wcathcr, he thinks it as well not
to have the fun number. ‘ Capra,' ⁴ caper,' ‘ hircns,' are all used to signify
the smeil from 1110 arm-pits when they pei-spire.

30. Tu quotus esse velas] He had only to say how many persons he wished
10 have, and lcave the rest to the host. Horace advises his friend not to

come out at the front door, ‘ ostium‚' or ‘junua atriensis,' for fear 110 should
find a client waiting to catch him, but at the back door, ‘posticum ostium,'

which the Greeks called ψευδόθυρον, 0 false door.

EPISTLE VI.

Wno Numicius was, nobody 0011 tell, and it is 01· 110 1111 01101100. Any
other name would 1111ὐο donc as well. Nothing turns upon 0 character or

circumstances of the erson nominally addresscd.
As to the design o 1110 Epistle‚ it is to support virtue, under the aspect of
a 0111111 sels-content as the chief good. The ordinary standards of ha pir¹1¹egsls²

are treated with contem t, and there is a strong vein of irony running
the greater part of the pistle.

1. Nil omnir-ari] It is sels-control, or the power of kecping 1110 mind in an
equable fmme, that Horace says is the only means of making a man hapffi
and keeping him so. ⁸ Nil admirari' can only be said to be necessary to t
rule when admiration amounts to a stupid wonder, excessive fcar, excitement,
or other effecta by which the judgmcnt is misled and the passione roused in·
juriously. As to ‘propc‚' sce S. ii. 3. 32, 11.

4. :mit qui formidine nulla] ‘ Formido' is bete eqxinsxeuxmnemmvmkn«
