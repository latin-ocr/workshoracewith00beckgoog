ODE VIII.

Tms Ode was eornposed on the anniversary of IIoraee’s accident with the
tree (C. ii. 13). It is addreesed to Maeeenns, whom he invites to join him in
eelebmting the day, which was the lst of March, B. c. 25, or thereabouta.

Aaou-mm. -·- Wonderest thou, learned friend, what this sacrifice means
on the Kalends os March, and 1 a bacheler ’ἓ On this day 1 was delivered
from death, and it shall be a holiday. Come, Maecenas, a hundred cupa of
my oldest wine to the health of thy friend. Away with anxiety. The Du-
eian has fallen, the Mede is divided against himself, the cantabr-ian is in
einins, and the scythim has unstrung his bow. Be here the private gentle-
man: never mind the people; enjoy thyself and unbend. ·
