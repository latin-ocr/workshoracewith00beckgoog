EPODE 1.

Wmm Augustus had determincd on the expedition against M. Antonius
and Cleo which led ιο the battle of Actium, n. c. 31, he summoned, as
we learn m Dion Cassius (50. ll), the leadi senators and men of Eques·
trian rank to meet him at Brundisium, for difficnefit of their mansel, and
(the histor-ian says) ιο keep the Faluestrians from mischief‚ and also ιο show
the world the harmony ιο which he had bro nrht men of all orders at Rome.
Maeccnas obeyed this summons, and went ιο tundisium, but was sent back
by Augustus ιο watch over the peace os the city and the affairs of Italy. It

was going l:figimthat service, until, on his arrival at Brundisium, Augustus
thought fit ιο send him back to discharge more important dutics at Rome.
Horace, supposing him ιο be oing, wished to accompany him, bnt Maecenas
would not allow it (v. 7), w iich gave occasion for this Epode. It is an
affcctionate remonstrance against being left behind.

Aneuniates—Thou art going into the midst of danger, Moecenas, to
share the foi-tunes of Caesar. Shall 1 stay at home at ease, or meet the
danger with thoe, on whose life my happiness depends'l 1 will go with thee
withersoever thou goest. Το what end shall I go ἲ As the bird fcars less
for her young when she is near them, so shall 1 sear lcss for thee, if 1 go with
thee, and 1 go ιο win th love, not thy savem? Thy love bath given me
enough. I seek not wide ds or fine houscs and cattle, and gold ιο hide or

to aquander.

1. Liburnis These were light vessels, that took their name from the ships
used by the iburnians, a iratical tribe on the Illyrian coast. Augustus
employed them in his expeditione against Sex Pompeius, and they were of
great use at Actium (C. i, 37. 30). All writers on the battle of Actium de-
scribe the shi of M. Antonius and Cleopatra as of enon-mous size. Like
those of the recks, which the Romans copied, the Egyptian vessels were
fitted with nowers (⁴ propugnacula '), from which the men fought.
