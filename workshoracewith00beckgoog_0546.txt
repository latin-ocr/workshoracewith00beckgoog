1. Vinios silvam] The ‘villicus ' wne one of the principiul eleves in the
‘ familia ·ruetice.‚' who had the superintendeuce of a. mnu ε farm and ‘ vina rue-
tica.’ He collected hie rents, looked efter his slaves, and had charge of every-
thing but the cattle, of which there was a. se arete superintendent. Horace
says his woods and fields restored him to ‘msclf; that ie, they gave him
libert and enjoyment of lise.

2. matum quinque sotis] ‘Focis ' ie put for ‘familia’ Horace says
there lived on his estate five familiee, the heads of which were good men, .
who went up from time to time to the neighboring town of Varia.. Some
suppose they were ‘coloni' (C. ii. 14. ll, n.), leeseee who sarmegi different
parts of the estate. Varia was thirty miles from Rome, and ten from Tibur,
on the Via Valeria. It wne four miles from Horaee's farm. Ite modern
name is Vico Varo.

5. an rea] Hie land. ‘Praedia’ were ‘ree mancipi! ·

6. [Δηιίαε] See Introd. to C. iii. 17. ⁴ Insolabiliter' occure nowhere else.

9. rumpere claustra] At the end of the circus were stans (carceres '), in
which the chariote remained till the race was ready to begin. They were
then brought out, and ranged aide by side behind a rope called ‘ alba liuen'
or ‘calx,’ which wan stretched across the course, end formed a. barrier, be-
yond which the chariooe could not advance till the signal was given and the
rope withdrawn. Itis from this obstruction, or from the ‘cometem’ that the
metaphor in the text ie taken. ·

13. se non e uqit unquam. Compare C. ii. 16. 19.
14. Tu maile-antinus] He nd been one of the lowest slaves, used for an

manner of work in the ‘familia urbana: and by his pitiful countennnce (for
he was afraid perhaps to epeak) had shown how much he wished to be de·
livered from that condition, and to be sent to work on the farm, though that
ffiffiffiffffi‘ffi ‘itss530fflffsssfflnsshffieffffiffi εὶ ῗὲέἁῑὲὲῗὼῗζέῖ
was the nauie for the lowest sort of slave, bot’h in the town and country ee-
tablishment. It ie derived from ‘mediue,’ from hie standing in the midst,
aud being at eve one’s cnll.

ffifffflnoenit] ΕΡ '1³³0' &¹112 &fulde the differenee between· me and you!

19. tesca] ‘ Tesca ’ means any rough wilderncss. It ιε a rare word.

21. uncta popina As to ‘ pina’ (which Horace calle ‘unctu' because
of the grene vian s cooked t ere), see S. ii. 4. 62, n.

23. Α us isteseret] Horace writes as if ho were repeating the contempt-
uous languuge of the villicus. ‘That little nook of yours would produce
pepper and frankincense (which of course was impossible) sooner than
grupen! The pes grown ou the farm he did not think worthy of the
name. Thet oraoe made his own wine, and that it wne not too bad to put
before Maecenae, we know from C. i. 20. Popper the encients must have
obtained, through some channel, from India. -‘ Thus ’ or ‘ tus olibanum,'
which is a gum-resin, exmd fmm a nee called now the Bosweuia Thuri-
fera, was brought chiefly from Arabia. See virgil (Georg. ἰ. 57): “ India
mittit ebur, molles sua turn Sabaei.”

25. meretrix tibicina,] The ‘ tibia' was played by women ns well aa meu,
und chiefly by women at meula.

26. ettamen myos] This is said with a sort of mock compassiou: ‘And
yet, poor man! (though you have none of these comforts to help yon on
our way,) you heve to go on turning up the rough soil, feeding the oxen,
fooking out for floods, and ull that! ‘Jampridem non tacta’ impliee thet
Horace’s phrggerty had been neglected before it came into hie ion.
