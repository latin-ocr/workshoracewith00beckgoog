the first Lamioe had their name from Lamua, and the earne tradition has
come down through their successor-s in the annale of the family, no doubt
you draw your origin from that noble source ’ ς —in which there is nothing
more than a little jocular irony, which would amuae Lamia, whether it
pleaeed his family pride or not. The poeta, both Latin and Greek, osten
omit the personal prononn, even when it ia wanted sor emphasis, aa here and
in C. i. 1. 35, “ Quod ei me lvricis vatibus ineerie,’' where Maecenas ia em·

16. operum solatia] This construction, like “desine quent-larum’' (C. ii
