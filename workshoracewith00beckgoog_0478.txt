' 21. affer—lavasset Sisyphus aere,] Homer (Il. vi. 153) calls Sisyphus
κὶρδιστος ἀνδρῶν.. Damasippus says hc used, before he lost 811 1118 money, to
'employ himself in purchasing and reselling all kinds of valuable roperty;
among the rest, vessels of Corinthiam bronze (often, but improperl’y, called
111888), of such anti uity that Sisyphus, the founder of Corinth, might be sup-
posed to have 8883 them for washing his feet. The rage for antiquated

25. Mer-curiale] Damasippus means that his skill in making ba ains was
80 well known, that he was called, 811 over the town, 8 ward of erem-y.
The mom usual construction is with the dative. See below, v. 4⁷, n. ⁸ Com-
'pita' were those spots where two or more stt-oeta converged to 8 point, or
crosscd one another. At these places idlers lounffil, and passengem stopped,
if they were 80 disposcd, to offer 8 rayer to the res pu liei or Compitales,

whose altars were ereeted there. ( “ below, v. 281, n.)

by the later Greek wn’ters. The Pons FabriciuS, from which Damasippus
was going to throw himself into the river after he became bankrupt, con·
nected the Insula Tiberina with the left bank, and was just outside 1110 walls,
facing the south end of the Mons Capitolinus. It had lately been rebuilt with
810118, having been fonnerly (88 may be supposed) made of wood. There

· are still ruins of this brid , which now bears the name Ponte di Quattro
