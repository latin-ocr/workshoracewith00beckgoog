Salamis, that island on the southern coast of Attica where Themistocles
defeated the forces of Xerxes. When he returned from Tro , his father
refused to receive him, because he came without his brother, eoeupen he

Cicero. Teucer selected Hercules as his protector, and so wore a emwn of
poplar, which was sacred to that hero. See Virg. Aen. viii. 276.
