Romans had a great variety of tables of the handsomest sertin their ‹lining-

iii. 19. 12), and these it is probable were usually empty. The ‘echinus ’ is a
vessel nowhere else mentioned by that name, und is variously interpreted ns
a salt-oellnr (in the shape of an ‘echinus ’ or see-hedgehog), a glass bottle, a
leather bottle, and a wooden bowl in which to wssh the cu s. ‘Paterae '

feeling thet he must be up early to ro to the orum, where a statue of Mar-
syas wns ereeted near the Rostra. ‚vas was a subulous person, who was
said to have challenged Apollo to lay the lym against his flute. Apollo,
having gained the Victor-y, caused §lm-syna to be flayed alive. Marsyas or
Silenus was the symbol of s. city having· the Jus Italicum, one pert of which
was s. free constitution of its own. It would therefore appear ιιι the Forum
ns the symbol os free jurisdiction. The onl representatione os Marsyas that
remain, exhibit him either in the ny o punishment, or in the suspense
that preceded it. Wherefore “a γα counteuanee” was synonymous
with dejectiori und ill-humor; and Horace seems to indicate that his fuce was
(listened, and ascribes it humommly to his detestation of the younger No-
vius, who is said to have been a usurer.

man to sleep (Epp. i. 17. 6). Sometimes he got u early and went out to

self (‘ tacitum ’) and in bed, es much as he se t inclined, he nnoiuted himself
with oil, und went to the Campus Martius to get some exercise. The Ro-
mans rubbed oil on their dimin, either before swimming in the Tiber- (C. iii.

Horace was tired with his geme, he went to e public baths to buthe, which
was usual nster leving, and then took a light luncheon (see above, S. 5. 25, ’
