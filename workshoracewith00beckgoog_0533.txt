EPISTLE VII.

On some occasion Horace, having gone into the country for chan ef air
on aceount of his health, at the beginning of August, was temp · to my
away the whole mouth ; and aa he had promrsed Mae-enasfo return m a sev

noe’n societ at this time. We can only guther the tone os his letter or mes·
uage from t e chat-amtor of Horaee’s reply. He says he has no mind to risk

rather than forfeit his liberty. He illus-uates his position by two stenes,—
one that of the fox who got into a vessel of corn nnd grew so fat there that
he could not get out again {which Horace was determined to prove was not
hin case), and the other a ⁸ enetic trick played by L. Philippus upon a wor-

1. Quinque dies] This is a conventional hrme to express any short time.
It occurs in S. i. 3. 16, “ quinque diebus Ni erat in loculis.''

2. Smuem] In n. c. 8 this mouth first received the name of Augustus.

5. dum ficus prima calorque] See S. ii. 6. 18, n. The ‘designator' was
the mun who arranged the processioa at the funeral of any im mut penson,
,⁸¹¹⁶ the ‘lictores ’ were his attendants who kept order. (boe . i. 6. 43.)

8. officiosaque additas] That is, attending upon great people, and ω
forth. It does not seem aa if the diminutive form ‘opella' had any particu-
lar soree. Horace uses diminutives when it suits the measure.

10. Quodsi bruma nives Albanis] ‘ Si ' is used with rofi-renco to a fatum
event, even if it be not hypothetical‚ when any action depeuds upon that
