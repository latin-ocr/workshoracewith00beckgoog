sl. Virtam msa podas] Comp. “ Aut virtus nomen mane est,’' etc,
ξιιμ. 17. 41). ‘Lucus’ is usually a grove dedicated to some divinity, and

oraee may mean that the man had no regard sor what others held sacred,
hut counted a consecrated ve no better than any other wood- Or, sines
‘lucus ' was sometimes indifferenti for any wood, Horaoe may mean, ·
‘ if you think virtue eonsists only of wortss, as a grove does of trees!

business before yson arrive.'' e sup him a ‘ne γη· tor‚’ the business
of which class was chiefly that 'os banffing and money· ending, but they also
engaged in mereantile transactione, the differenee between them and ‘ merea·
tores ' being, that the latter travelled with their own war-es, while the ‘ nego-
ciatores ' did business in a neral way.

33. Ne Cibyram] ‘ ciffis-a Major' was situated on a branch of the In-
dus, on the northwest borders of Lycia. It was called ‘ major: to distinguish
it from a smaller town on the coast of Pamphylia. Twenty·five towns be*
lenm to the conventus of Cibyra, and its commercial transactione wem
pm ly large. Aa to ‘Bithyna negotia,' see C. iii. 7. 3, ιι. ‘Negotia' is
commonly used for the business transactione of a ‘ negociator,' as Cieero, in
his letter intmducin Manlius Sosis to AciliuS, proconsul of ·Sicil (Ad Fam.
xiii. 20), says, ⁴⁴ ha t negotia vetera in Sicilia sua.'' He had (fehta to get
in, and accounts of old standing to settle.

“ 34. Mi& talenta mundmmr On ‘talenta,' see S. ii. 7. 89, ιι. ‘ Rotundo’
is not used in this sense espen· cre. The meaning is the same as ours when
we talk of a round number: it is a complete number, leaving out fmctions.
⁴ Porro ’ means · further! ‘ Quadrat acervum‚’ ‘ makes the fourth side of the
aquare: as it were. In the next verse ⁴ fldem ' signifies ⁴ credit!

37. myina Pecunia] ‘ Pecunia ’ is here personilied and made a myal lady,
and Juvenal apostrophiass her thus:

“ Funesta Pecunia, templo
Nondum habitas, nullas nummorum ereximus aras. ' (i. 113.)
Horace here repeats in effect what he said in S. ii. 3. 94; .
“ Omnis enim res,
Virtus, fama, decus, divina humanaque pulchris
Divitiis parent.”

38. Suadela Vanaque] ⁸ Suadela' is another form of Suada, who repre-
sented the Greek divinity Πειθώ, Pemuasion. The name, Cicero tells us,
was Latinized by Ennius (Brut. 15). Πειθώ was usually associated with
Ἀφροδίτη. and their statues stood together at Athens, where it is pretty eer-
nin Horace must have seen them. 1 cannot find that Suada had any temple
or separate worship at Rome. She was sn to assist Venus in resid-
ing at ' , and she, the Graees, and ercury were the aeknow edged
companions o that goddess. Therefore Horace associates them here. Cicero

, tells us (Cat. Mai. xiv. 50) that Ennius called the cl nent M. Cethegus

‘⁴ Suadae medullam,'’ ‘the marrow of persuasion! See pp. ii. 2. 117, ιι.)
· 39. Mancipir's locuples] See S. ii. 7. 3, ιι. Cap ocia was governed by
its own kings from a very early period. The last was Archelaus, who was

At his death (A. ι). 17) Cap ocia was reduced to the form of a Roman
province, in the third year o Tiberius (Tacitus, Ann. ii. 42). He had landa
and slaves on them, and prope of that sort, but wanted the precious metal.
