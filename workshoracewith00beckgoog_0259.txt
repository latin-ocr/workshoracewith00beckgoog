Medus for Medicus, is the only form Horace uses. The country of the
Marsi, east of Rome, Umbria, and Lucania were all famous for boare, being
abundant in acorna, on which they fed and grew fat. Laurentian boare were
also celebrated. See S. ii. 3. 234; 4. 41. 43.

ODE 11.

Tms Ode seems to ave been written on the return of Angustus to Rome,
after the taking of exandria‚ when the civil wars were brought to a close
and the temple of Janus was shut, n.c. 29. Horace here urges Augustus
to take upon himself the task of reducin to order the elements of the state,
which so many years of civil war had rown into confusion, and he does
so in the following manner. He refers to the prodigies at Julius Caesar's
death, as evidences of the divine wrath for the guilt of the civil wars. Hc
then invokes one god after another to come and restore the state, and finally
fixes upon Mercury, whom he entreats to take upon himself the form of a
man, and not to leave the earth till he has accomplished his mission and
confluere-d the enethi-es of Rome. The man whose form Mercury is to take
ts agustus. ·

If this Ode is read with C. ii. 15, and the others mentioned in the intro·
duction to that Ode, the fcelin with which Horace entered into the mimion

' &Augustus as the reformet· be better understood.
