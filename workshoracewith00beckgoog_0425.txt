besides Tigellius, who was dead, it is mmble many living persons felt in-
'ured by that Satire, and perhaps by ot ers that have not come down to ιιι.
e may infer from the present poem, that Horace wished to clear himself
from the imputation of a censorious spirit, and so to set himself right with
Maecenas and his friends. The connection between the two &tire-js seen iu
the opening of this, in which Tigellius is again introduced, and the peculiar-
ities of his character described, for no other reason, as it would amm, than to
serve as a text for the ‹lim-onrse that follows, on the duty of judging others
eharitably‚ as we wish to be judged ourselves. In the course of his remarks
on this subject, llomee falls upon two of the Stoic alisurdities3 one, that all.
faults are alike (v. 96, q.), which he meets b the Epicurean absurdity nm
expedieney is the sou ation of right5 and the other, that eve-y wius man
(that is, every Stoic) is endowed with ull the gitis of ert and fortune, frum the
eskill of tlhe mechania to the power of a king. With a jest upon this fully the

4. Te‘yellius] See Introduction. This person is described ιι a. cmpridous,
inconsistent man, of whom you never could tell what he would do next.

6. ub ovo Usque ud mala] The ‘pmmulsis,' otherwise called ⁸ επεὶ-ηιξ
preceded the regular moal, and consisted of things calculated tovaoke tho
appetite, of which a listis given in the eiglith Satine of the socon book, v. 8,

ovo usque ad rnala‚' ‘from the eggs to the dessem' was a common way d
speaking. The ‘ mistus ' was caten with a dmught os ‘ mulvium ⁹ (S. ix. 8.
15, n.) sometimes before thev sat down. or even before they left the bath.

7. m'tarat, Io &mv-1101] This use of ⁴ citare‚’ ‘to shout,’ is not common.
There were convivial song-s anione: the Greeks to which they gave the mmo

ἷόβακχοι. Several framnents of such songs by Archilochus have been pre-
served. The final syllable in ‘Bacche’ is lengthened, und should properly
be pronounced as the singer might be supposed to pronounce it.

modo summa] The stringe in the tetrachord‚ or harp with four εἴη·
which continued to be used even nster the. heptachord was invented see Αᾯ,
83, n.)‚ from which the low notes proceedcd, were uppermost as e player
held it. in his hand, and thc- notcs of the voice which corresponded with theto
are expres-sed by ⁶ summa voee.' For the same teti-zon, tho high notes would
be those which harmonizcd with the lowest of the stringe. The ‘summ
chorda’ was called in Greek ὑπάτη. und the ‘ima ’ νήτη. ‘ Chordis ' is 'fine
dative case, the liternl translation lming, ‘that voice which is the lowest
(where, for the above reason, those notes are called the lowest which we
should call the highest), and that echoes to the four strings.'

12. modo reyes atque terrm-chanst ‘Modo,’ as an adverb of time, significo
‘ now,' or some time not far from the present.. It is the ablativo of ‘ modunl
‘mensuum’ and ‘modo' is ‘within mensuress and therefore its sense is con-
finecl to limited quantities. Com are the use os ‘niodo’ and ‘admodum ’

you coming now? —Jnst now! ‘Modo’ thus comes to have the meaning
of ‘ nunc,' and to be used in the same combinatione, us here ‘ nunc reges-
