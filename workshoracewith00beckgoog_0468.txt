at the beginning of this war, independent states tn close alliance with the
Samnites, but aster the first year they found it for their interest to desert
those allies, and joined the Romans, with whom they continued to unite their
forces till the end of the war. Horace's supposition tliat one or other of
those states was meditating or carrying on war with Rome, is not, therefore,
strictly accuratu but they were always very doubtful allies, and were glad to
assist their old enemies the Greek cities in their resistance to Rome, when
they called in the help of Pyrrhus; and it was not till the fall of Tarentum,
B.· c. 272, that these, in common with the other southern states of Italy, final-
ly acknowledged the supremacy of Rome, and accepted their freedom from
her. It was in consequence of the commanding position of Venusia, in refer-
ence to the three natione of the Samnites, Apulians, and Lucaniam, that the
Romans sent there in the above year (n. c. 291) a colony of twenty thousand
persons. This place was of t use to the Romans m the war with Pyr-
rhus. After their reverse at e battle of Heraclea, A. n. c. 474, the temnant
of their army :etmated to Venusia, and here many found refuge aster the
defeat of Canna. The quantity of the second syllable in Venusinus, Horace
makes short here, and in C. i. 28. 26. Juvenal lengthens it (vi. 167) 2
“ Malo Venusinam quam te, Cornelia, mater Gracchorum,'' where, as here,
the humble inhabitant of Venusia is conti-ested with the proud matmn of
Rome. ‘ Quo ne'l(v. 37) is an unusual expression, in which ‘quo' is re·
dandam.

but the abruptus-ss of the several clauses is well suited to the occasion ι ‘ but

He is not the man mentioned tn S. ii. 6. 77. ⁸ Urnam ’ means either the um
into which the judices put their tablets, or that into which their names were
put for drawing the jury. Either way it is equivalent to ‘judicinm.'

50. thue quisque mla In what follows it is Horaee’s pu se to show
that it is a law of nature t at every one should use the means o defence that
are given him, and he is only acting on this law when he employs satire in
sels-defense. ‘ Unde '- in v. 52 belongs to ‘ monstratum,’ as, in the next Sa-
tire, v. 31, “ Unde datum sentis,'’ ‘bv what suggested if not from within ’.ἱ ’
of Scoeva we know nothing. What Horace says is, that he would, like other
animab, resort to the means most natural to him, which were not violence,
to which cowards have an aver-sion, bnt poison.
