'rma Ode is addressed to C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and companion in
arms of Julius Caesar. In nc. 40 he was consul, and in the following year
he was sent by M. Antonius against the Parthini, a tribe of Illyricum, and
having defeated and subdued them ho was allowed a triumph on his return
to Rome. He then betook himself to literature, and raetismg as an orator
in the courts of justice, and speaking in the senate. fle patronized literary
men, built a library, wrote poeti-y, particularly tragediae, and composed a
history of the ciyil wars, in most of which he had taken an active part. The
Ode was written after hearing Pollio meite part of this work, a practice
{isich he is said to have been the first to introduce mnong literary men at

me.

Anemur— The civil wars, their causes, their progr-ess, and their fatal
results, — a dangerous task is thine, and treacherous is the ground thou art

Leave the tragic Muse for a little while, and thou shalt return to her when
thou hast finished the historian's task, O Pollio! advocate, senator, oon-
quemr! Even now 1 seem to hear the trumpet and the clarion, the flush-
ing of arms, and the voices of chiefs, and the whole world subdned but the
stubborn heart of Cato. The gods of Africa have offered his victors’ grand-

sons on the tomb of Jugurtha. What land, what waters, are not stained '

with our blood ’ἐ But stay, my Muse, approach not such high themes.

1. Motum ex Metello consule] The foundation of the civil wara is here laid
in the formation of the (so-called) triumvirate by Caesar, Pom iuS, and
Crassus, which took place in the consulship of Q. Caecilius Mete ns Celer,
and L. Afranius, a. u. c. 694, B. c. 60. But though this was the first great
aet of aggression on the liberties of Rome, the civil war did not break out
till the year Α. u. c. 704, n. c. 50, when Caesar and Pompeius came to their
final rupture. Pollio's work was in seventeen books, and probably ended
with the battle of Aetium.

4. Principum macitias The allianee o Caesar and Pompeius, and the
subsequent coalition of . Antonius and Augustus, mone than once broken

and therefore called ‘gravesj ‘ o pressive,’ are hem principal y referred to.
