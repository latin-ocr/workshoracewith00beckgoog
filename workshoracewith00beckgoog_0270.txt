1. ιᾶυᾌαῡηηε] This future ts like ‘scriberis’ in the last odo (v. 1),
‘ others shall if they please! ‘ Claram ' means ‘ bright,’ with reference to its
cloudlcss skies. ‘ Bimaris ' is an unusual word. It refers to the position
of Corinth, which, standing at the south of the isthmus, commanded the
shore of the Sinus Corinthiacus, by two long walls reaching from the town
to the sea, and bad its eastern port Cenchrcae on the Sinus Saronicus.

5. Sunt quibus] ‘ There are those who make it the single business os their
lives to tell of chaste Minerva’s city in unbroken song, and to gathcr a -
branch from every olive to cutwine their brOW.' A ‘ perpetuum car-men ³
is a continuone poem, such as an Epic ; and ‘ a branch from every olivc,' or,
more literally, an ‘ olive-branch from every quarter‚' means that the various
themes connected with the glory of Athens am as olive-trees, from each of
which a branch is plucked to bind the poet's brow. The figure is appro-
priate to the locality, where the olive flourishcd and was. sacred to Minerva
(see Herod. v. 8. So h. Ocd. Col. 694, sq .). We do not know of any oem

She had a celebrated temple between Argos and Mycenae called the Ἡραῖον.
Homer (11. ii. 287) calls Argos ἱππόβοτον (‘ aptum equis ’)‚ the plain in
which the city was placed being famous sor brecding homes.

‘Dices Mycenas ' is later: Μυκήνας τὰς πολυχρύσους (Soph. Elect 9).
‘ Opimae Larissae ' is Homeric ; Αάρισσα ἐριβώλαξ (Il. ii. 841). There

‘ Percussit ' is general y used with the· ablativo o the instrument or cause.
Standing alone in this way, aud in the aoristie perfect, it savors very much of

ἔπληξε, which is used in the same sense.

gave her name to a grove and fountain. See Virg. Aen. vii. sl, q.
