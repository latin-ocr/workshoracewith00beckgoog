ODE XXXV.

another for the Ean, Horace commended hun to the care of Fortune the Pm-
oerver, to whom thia Ode is addressed. The design of invadi Britain was

dess Fortuna, under different characters, had many temples at Rome ; but her
worship was most solemnly maintained, when Horace wrote, at Praeneste and
at Antium, where she had an oraclo, and was worshipped under a double
form, as ‘prospera' and ‘adver-sa! Tacitus mentions a temple helon '
