ειιὸη describam of Horaoe’s residem, ivi antidpation of the inquiries he
supposes Quintius might make on that subject.

1. fundus] See S. ii. 5. 108, n. ι

2. Arva paseat hmm] Horace had some of his land under his own culti-
vation; but it was no great quantity, as we may infer from the number of
slaves employed upon it (S. i1. 7. 118). The rest he seems to bave let (Epp.
14. 2, ιι.). Part of his laud was amble, and part of it meadow (Epp. 15.
26-30, and C. iii. 16. 30, “ tis certa fides meae '’). He had a garden
ἑέὶρρ. 14. 42). He must also ave had vines (23, n.). In short, it was an

inary farm on a small scale. In the second and third verses Horace re-
eoltzxntgo the tgiffemm productione of his farm, while he supposes Quintius to

ulmos.” · ·

5. Contintd montes] The valley of the Licenza is the only valle which
cuts the range of mountains extending from the Camp a above ibur to
Carseoli, about fort —tive miles from Rome. withoutffi valley this im·
mense body would a continuous mass. It lies nearly north and south,
which corresponds with the description of the text. See C. i. 17. l, n.

8. Temperiem laudea] The position of the valley keeps it eool in summer
and warm in winter, the latter by the exclusion of the north wind (Tr-amon-
ωηο). The Seiroceo (‘p}umbeus Auster’) is modified in its strength and
character as it penetrates the mountains.

Quid, si rubicunda] ‘Why, if 1 tell you that my thorus bear abundantly
the red cornel and the plum, that my oaks and my ilexes delight my pige
with plenty of aeorns, and their master with plenty of shade, you may say it
,is the woods of Tarentum, brought nearer to Rome! ‘Fruge' is nowhere
else used for acor-ns, the common food for pige.

12. Fons etiam} There are two small streams which seed the Licenza in
this valle , which that river nearly bisects. Either of these rivulets may be
the one orace alludes to.

14. fluit utalia} See note on v. 8 of the last Epistle.

· 15. dulces, etiam si credis amoenae,] A place may be ‘ dulcis ’ from associ-
atiou or other causes: it ean only be ‘ amoenus ’ from its elimate, its beauties,
and so forth. As to ‘ Septembribus horis,' see S. ii. 6. 18, ιι., and for ⁴ audis '
see note on v. 20 of the same Satiro.

17. Da reete vivis] He goes on to compliment and advise his friend:
‘Your life is what lt should be, if you are careful to be what you are ac·
counted. For all Rome has long spoken of you as a happy man. But 1 am
afraid lest you should trust the judgmeut of others about you, rather than

our own!
y 24. pudor malus] See S. ii. 3, 39, n. He says it is a false shame' that
would induce a patient to conceal his sores from the phvsician; and so it is
for a man to hide his desecte, rather than bring them to the wise to cure.

25. Si quis bella eibi] ‘ Tibi ' depende on ‘ pugnata,’ which is 'oincd with
‘bella' in C. iii. 19. 4. See note on C. ii. 6. ll. Quintius ha no doubt
seen service ; but, says Horace, it· any one were to speak of your campaign-
ing in such langua as this (then he quotes two lines, said to be taken from
the panegyrie of arius on Augustus, referred to on C. i. 6. ll), you would
recognize it as meant, not for you, but for Caesar. But if you allow yourself
to be called wise and correct, does your life correspond to that name any
more than your military exploits to the above encomium? Liter-allyi ‘Do
you answer in your own name,' or ⁸ on your own account? ξ υκαι-8
