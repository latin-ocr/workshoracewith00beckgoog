Aug-ustus, mfflelently describe the spirit of it, though ita mfoeaect purpose is
to celebrate the part that Tiberius took, with l)1·usus,in e victories ove-r the
German tribes. It is probable that, whereas the Ode for Drusus was written
soon after his victory, thia was not written till Augustus returned from Gaul,
two years afterwards.

Amnum—with what honors shall we rpetuate thy vii-tues, Ο

mightiest of princes, whose strength the insolent vindelici have felt? With
great slaughter Drusus cast them down from their heights‚ and Tiberius
drove them before him, as the south wind driven the waves, or the swellen
Aufidus lays waste the corn,— a scathless victory; and thou didst lentl thine
amnica, thy counse18, and thine auspices. 'T was fifteen years from that day
when Alexandria o cncd her gates to thee, that Fon-tune brought this glory
to thine anns· Alf natione bow down to thee, from the east to the west,

from the north to the south, Ο thou guardian of Italy and Rome!

Epp. ii. l. 48, n. ⁴ Aeternare' is a word which had probably income almost
obsoleto in Horace’a time. Itis not found in any other author, except in a
fragment of Vane. Many words used by Horace, and by no other extant
writer, were probably common enough before the age of Cicero. ‘ Habita-
biles oras,' like ἡ οἰκουμένη, so commonly used hy Plutarch and the writers
of the New Testament, si ¹unifica the Roman world. .

10. Genaunoe, The Genauni were one of the southern tribes of Raetia,
lying between t e lakes Verbanus (Maggiore2 and Larius (Come), iu the
modern Val d’ Agno. The Breuni were a stna l but warlike tribe, also occu-
pying part of Raetia. The character Horace ‘ves of these tribea is that which

20. Indomitos prope qualis} It may be observed, tbat the fourth verse of
the Aleaic stanza is frequently constructcd with a noun and its adjective in
the first and last place, and corresponding in their last syllables. In this Ode
we have vv. 12, 16, 20, 36, 52, answering to this rule or habit. ‘ Prope ' has
no particular force. Horace, whose ear was familiar with the language os th
Greek tragediam, copied their σχεδόν τι (a common phrase in comparisona}
here and in other laces. The Setting of the Plemdes, at the beginning of
November, was rec oned aa the comment-emeat of winter; they therefore are
