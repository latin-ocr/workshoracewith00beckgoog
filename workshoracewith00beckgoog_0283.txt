1. Vile pdabis modicis Sabinum Cbmharr's] It has been said before (C. 9.
7, 11.) that Sabine wine was none of the worst3 but it was cbeap aud pour
eom d with the beet, to which Moeccnas was used, and this probably had
not ad the bencfit of kccping. Horace commenda it, therefore, by resen-ing
to the circumstances under which it was bottled (las we should say) —Tho
most ordinary kind of cat-then-ware jug was cal cd ‘cantharum' supposed
ω be the name os its inventor. Horace had tried to improve his wine b
11111111ιῆι 3] ing} a ‘ testa ' or ‘ amphora‚' which had contained ,nome of the ric
mg? ΙφειίζΐΞ Τέιξαὲοὼ of the “testa ’ was covered with pitch or gypsum
aster the wine was put into it, and this Horace says he did with is own
hand. Hc would at the same time scal it with his own ocal, and attach to it
a label with the date, and he could so vouch sor ita being the wine hc elpeakss
of. And when he says he did it with his own hand, he means a ao ω
show the paine hc had taken to celebrate Maecenas's ret-every. ‘ Condere '
“fid (1116·ηὲᾶοωέ were the worda used for putting the wine into the ‘am-

ora.’ . 9. , 11.

p 5. Chre( Maecenas ›eques,l Moeccnas was content with the equestrian rank,
and would take no highcr: hence the frequent repetition os the title ‘eques '
by Horace and others. (See C. iii. 11120.) It appears that Maeceuae re-
covered from a had attat-k of sever the same year that Horace was nearly
killed by the falling of a tree, and the first time hc went to the theatre after
his recovery the pco le received him with applause. ‘rho circumstance is
referred to again ing ii. 17. 22, sqc}¹

7. Vataecam Montis amaya] The t eatre must have been that os Pompeius
which was opposite to the Vatican hill, on the left bank os the river, the 11111
being on the right or Etruscan bank, which gives propriety to the words
‘ paterni fluminis ri ae! Tho second syllable of Vaticanus is long 111 Mar·
tial and Juvenal. n ‘imago ’ ece above, C. 12. 3. 11.

10. Tu bibes] The future has here the same signification as above, C. 6.
1, 7. l. ‘ You may drink, if you please, the richer wines. I have none anch!
‘ Caecubum ' was the flnest sort os wine in IIoraco’s time. It was grown in
the ⁸ Caecubus ager,’ in Latium, at the head of the hay os Amyclae. 'rho
Calenian was from Cales (now Calvi) in Campania. Close by Cales was
the ‘ Falernus ager‚’ which produced several varieties os the best uality.
The hillo about Formiae on the Appia via (nee S. 1. 5. 37, 11.) proguced a

good wine.
