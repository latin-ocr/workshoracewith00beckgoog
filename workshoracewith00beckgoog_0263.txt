ODE ΙΙΙ.

Tms Ode is addoesscd to the ship that was carrying Virgil the poet ou
some occasion to Greece. His constitution was weak, and he probably made
several voyages for the sake of his health. He went, and only returned to
die in n. c. 19, but this ode was written before then. It is taken up with re-
proaches against him who first invented navigation‚ and a lament for the
presumption of mankind.

Aaou'xssr. — We commit to thee Vin-gil, Ο thou ship ! dcliver him use
on the shores of Attica, and preserve him whom I love as my life 3 and may
the skies and winds prosper thee. Hurtl and rash was the man who first
tempted the sea and defied the winds. In what shape should he fear the
“pff‘t'puch of {lle-ath, who untaogcd could loolltK o‘n tlhe monsltzm ὦ the deep,

sin. Prometheus brought tire into the world, und with that theft came all
manner of diseases ; Daedalus som-ed on wings, and Hercules burst into hell.
Deterred by nothing, we would climb heaven itself; aud our guilt suffers
not Jove to lay asido ’his bolts.

1. Sic] ‘ Sic' in this place amounts to no more than ‘utinam' in a
stmng form, as ὣς does in Greek. The-re are other passages where ‘sie'
follows the prayer (εἰπὲ which it de . nds‚ as C. i. 28. ²⁵? h dm

where the condition and its con uence are clearly marked, and an posite
wish is itnplicd if the condition not fulfilled. But such is nototfie ease
here3 first Horace suyS, ‘ May the stars and winds prosper thee,’ and then
goes on, ⁴ O ship, deliver thy trust in sasety.'

‘Potens,’ like its kindred word πότνια, is used with a genitive· after it.
Venus (a Latin divinity) is confounded by the poets with the Greek Aphro-
dite, who, from her su 1posed origin, was imagine-d to have power over the
sea ; hence Horace ca ls her ⁴ marina ' (C. iii. 26. 5; iv. 11. 15). She hud
the title-s εὖπλοία, lauimus, had temples built for her in harbors, and is rep-
resented on coins with a rudder, shell, and dolphin. Her principul tem les
were at Idalium and Paphos in C vprus, in the island of Cythera off the el·
oponnesus‚ Eryx (C. 2. 33) and dus in Catia.
