next verse, see C. iii. 21. 6, n., and Epp. i.‘3. 35, ιι.
234. dominantia nomina solum Wrbuqua] As to ‘nomina verbaque,' see

S. i. 3. 103, n. ‘Dominantia nomina’ is an adaptationi of the Greek κύρια

ὀνόματος that is, literal words as opposed to figurative. Horace says he
shall not. confine himself to these if he ever takes to writing Satyrie DramaS.

236. truqieo differre odori] Aa to ‘differre' with the dative, see S. i. 4.
48 ιι.

238. Pythias emuncto] This seems to be the name of a slave-girl who got
money out of her master, Simo. As to ‘ emuncto,' see S. i. 4. 8, n.

239. διῖεπηε] This god is said to have edueatecl Bacchus, He represented
the ‘crassa Minerva'·of the ancients, ‘ wis-dom under a rough exterior,' and
it is in his graver character that Horace here view-s him. All ancient repre-
sentations of Silenus exhibit him as a gross impersonation of sensuality and
low fun, usually drunk, and riding u n an ass, with Fauns duneing about
him. Modern ideas have consoundc him with Bacchus, his foster-child.

240. Ex noto fictum carmen sequar-‚J ‘ Ex noto ¹ perhaps means that the
subject must be familiar. .

244. Fanm',] See C. ii. 19. 4, n. Horace says that these rough beings
introduced from the woods should not talk as if thev had been born iu the
city and were loungcrs in the Forum, or languish in' love-verses like a silly
youth ; but neither should low language he put into their mouth, for this ιε

‘Juvenor' is a word not found elsewhere: it is adapted from e Greek

were born free and of lawful wedlock, since none others were ‘ in patria po-
testate) As to ‘eieci-‚³ see S. i. 6. 115, ιι.

251. Syllaba lonya brevi] As to the ‘ iambus! see above, v. 79, sq. Horace
here calls it ‘pes citas,' a ra id foot, as elsewhere (C. i. 16. 24) he speaks'of
⁴ celeres iambos! He says t ie rapidity of the sont caused the division of the
verse into the form of a trimeter, whereas it was a ‘senariu3,' having six
distinet iambie feet. The admission os a spondeo in the odd feet, he says,
was an aster invention, in order to give more weight to the measure. ‘ hon
ita pridem ' means comparatively lately; but the verses of Archilochus had
spondees in them. The history is not. very accurate. Horace has himself
imitated the pure iambic measure in the alternate verse-s os Epod. 16. ‘ Ιιι
jura paterna recepit ’ is to be rendered ‘ gave a share os its pan-imony! The
meaning is clear enough from the context. The politencss of the ‘iambus '
in making way sor the spondeo, and giving up some of its just rights, but not
disposed to be so accommodating as to give up the even places in the verse,
seemshrather a heavy joken ‘ Socialiter,' ‘ in a friendly way,’ does not occur

258. Ilfc et in Acci] See Epp. ii. 1. 50. 56. The iambus, Horace says, is
not commonly used in tho verses of Accius and EnniuS. Those of the for-
mer he calls noble trimeters, by which he means finned. He was no great
admirer of them himself. The great weight he attributes to the verses of
Ennius arose from the gravity of the measure. consisting, as v. 200 does,
