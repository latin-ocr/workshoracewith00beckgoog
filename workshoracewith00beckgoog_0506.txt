the points he argues. Or he may have been giving Davus some good advice,

aud he offers him a homily in return, recommendiug him to practise what he
reaches.

P 3. Maneipium] This word, which roperly significs the act os taking pos-

session, ‘manu capiend0,' is applied ere to the ‘res mancipi,' the object of

affmlcaipiutssn’} which, in Sthi5s iln7stance, is a slave. It is so used in Epp. i. 6.

. s ‘ 1,’ see . . ‚ ιι.

4. Ue vitale miger] ⁶ That you need not think him too good to live’ (S. 6.
82). As to e Saturnalia, see S. 3. 5, ιι. The mouth of December wer
dedicated to Saturnus· Horace speaks of the license of that festival being a
eusitom ¹¹lianded down from their aneestors. The time of its institution is

ιι te u nown.
q 6. Pan hominum] Davus avuils himself, without prr-face, of his master¹s
issiou, and begins to moralize on the instability of some men, who never
m their own minds. This character he ap lies ιο his master in ν. 23, sqq.
' 9. Cum triba φύλαξ] This is mentionem? as a la number. In luter
times the Romans wore a great profusiori of tinge on th hands. At this
time they were only worn ou the left, because they were more likely to be iu-
jured, aud to be iu the way, on the right hand. Priscus was a senator, and
therefore entitled ιο wear a gold rin , which privilege did not descend, at this
time, below the equestrian order. n later times ιι was consen-ed upon all
manner of ersons by the emperors. These who were not entitled ιο wear
rin of golg had them of imn, according to the most ancient practice3 and
»nefor the Romans of higher condition as adhered to the simplicity of earlier
da s continued ιο wear iren. ,

’ , as a senator, vus entitled to go abmad with the ‘ latus clavus,'
which he would do sometimes; while at others he would appear only as uu
'equesl with the ‘angustus clavus? He was rich enough to live in a fine
hmse, aud did so ;- but would from caprice go and take an obscure lodging,
such as a poor man might be ashamed of. He putori first one character und
then another: now a man about town, and now talking os going to Athens
asa philosopher. He was just such an unstablo person as Tigellius is de-
scn‘bed ιο be, in S. i. 3. 18: “Nil fuit unquam Sic impar sibi.'' He was
‘⁸ everything by turns, and nothing long.''

14. Ver-tamnes, quot cot sunt, natus iniquum] Vertumnus, as his name-indi·
cates, was the god wg‘o represented change. Horace says Priscus was born
when Vertumnus was angry (see S. 3. 8, ιι., “Iratis nutus paries dis utque

gout, which Horace says he nchly deservcd, and was so iven to gembling·
· (which was illegal, see C. iii. 24. 58, n.)‚ that, when he eo d not handle the
dice-box himself, he hired a bey to do it for him. ‘ Phimus ' was the Greek
word for what the Romans called ‘ fritillas! From the shape it was also
called ‘turricula' or ⁶ yrgus' (πύργος). As to ‘talos,¹ see S. 3. 171, ιι.
They were not always irown from a box, but sometimes with the hand.

1⁹. levius miso· uc prior ium] ⁶ Levius miser’ is au unusual expression.
‘Prior illo’ means better off than that man who is always changing his
character, one moment appear-ing strict, another loose, iu his principles and
conduct. The superiority of the man who is consistent in vice lies in his
indiffereuee to virtue, and the quietuess of his conscience aris-ing from that
cause. In that sense he is better off, and less miserabl'e, than the other.

21. Non dices hodie,] ‘ Hodie’ is equivalent to ‘statim,' ‘this moment.'
‘ Furcifer ³ means a slave who for some slight offenee was obl· to go about
