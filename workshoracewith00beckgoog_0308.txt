ODE YI.

Or Septimius, to whom this Ode ia addressed, we know nothing, except
that he was an intimate friend of Horaee's, as we guther alno from the letter of
introduction he gave him to 'marius (Epp. i. 9). He had a house at Taren-
ffim, where Horf'agzp probably paid him oue or more visita. Beyond this we

ow no ' o timius.

It was pro bl on or after a visit to timim, that Hor-aee eompoeed‘ the
twenty-eighth O e of the first book3 an ‚ probabl ‚ with the attractione of
Tarentum fresh in his mind, he wrote this Ode. e says that, next to Ti-
butfiit is a? plaee where he would ehooee to end his days. He says the same
in pp. i. . 45. ’

with its houey, its olives, its long spring, and mild winter, and pes on
Mount Aulon. On that spot we ought to live together5 aud ere thou
