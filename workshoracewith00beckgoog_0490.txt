stand naked in the Tiber, to wash away his sins. This is intended to repne-
scut another fore· superstition, as the Romans held it, that of bathing the
body in token 01·ιῇἷὲ purifying of the soul.

295. Quone malo] See S. ι. 10. 21 οη ‘ quone.’ ‘ Timor deorum ’ is equiv-
alent to δεισιδαιμονῖα in its usual senso of superstition. ‘Deorum metns’
gprtesssffis a {ight fgar or reverence of the gods. But the distinction was not

va o serve .

296. stipantum odavus,] That is, he might take his place with the seven
vise men of Greece.

297. ns compellam· inultm] ‘ Compellare ’ is sometimes used absolutely
and in a bad sense, that is to abuse, as here.

299. “ iqnoeo] This refers to AEso 's fable of the two wallets,
which is to d, with its moral, in five lines by P aedrus (iv. 10) :

‘⁶ Peras imposuit Jupiter nobis duas:
Propriis repletam vitiis post tergum dedit,
Alienis ante pectus suspendit gravem.
Hac re videre nostra mala non possumus;
Alii simul delin nunt, censores sumuS.’'
300. sic vendas omnia ματίῃ] n ‘ sic,’ see C. i. 3. 1, n. ‘Pluris ’ is simply
ut sor ‘magno' Horat-e quietly hints to Damasi pus that he had better
seuve off philosophy and return to his trade, in which he wishes him all
success.

303. Agave] How she and the other Maenads tore her son Pentheus to

ξέοιοεε for intruding upon the orgies, is related at length by ovid. (Met. iii.
s .

sbsfftffidaeficm, hoc ως] ‘ You are building, which is as much as to say,
you, who are a dwarf two feet high, are aping the airs of a giant; and yet
you laugh at Turbo ( a gladiator of great cour-age, but small stature), swell·
mg with a spirit too big sor his little body! Horace may have been making
some additions to his Sabine house, and about this time Maecenas built his
large house on the Esquiliae. (See S. i. 8, Introduction.) ’

312. vet-mn est] δίκαιόν ἐστις ‘is it right&² ’ Compare Caesar, Β. G. iv. 8:
:13:030 vegs-[121⁰ esse qui suos fines tueri non potuerint alienos occupate.” 800

, 313. ancum dissimilem] A similar construction occurs immediately below
(ver. 317), ‘tantum magna! ‘ Multum similis’ (S. ii. 5. 92), ‘ multum dis-
similis ’ (Epp. i. 10. 3), are like phrases. ‘ Tanto ' is the dative governed by

certare! ’

,314. Abantis ranae] This fable is told by Phoedrus (i. 24).

318. Major dimidio. Num tanto 7] ‘ Greater by half: is a way of speakin
which must not be taken literally. B ‘num tanto' the frog means to as
whether the calf was so much bigger t an her natural siae as, b puffing, she
had made herself. ‘ Is it so much bigger‘ss ⁹ she says, blowing erself out to
ptgggrtzixdxffchnis wortdlzrccliissrz hahere else. It means to be out of har·
mon wi . .

δὲ. sanas] See A. Ρ. 296: “ Excludit sanos Helicone poetas Democri-
tus.” There is not much consistency in Damasippus nrging Horace to write
a} t-he beginning of the Satire, and calling him mad for doing so at the end
o it.

323. melam rubiam] This charge against himself need not be taken
seriously. We have no reason to believe Horace was an ill-tempercd man.
Hc lamenta the facilitv os his temper on one occasion. (S. i. 9. 11.) But he
⁸95⁸ he is irfimble. (xpp. i. ιο. 25.)
