92. Pastillos Rufillus σίας] This verse is quoted fmm a former Satira
(2. 27) only to show the innocent subjecta with which Horace's satire dealt,
aad he goes on to show that his satire has nono of the malignity which is
eommon m society. ‘ Pastillus ’ is a diminutive form of ⁸ panis,' and signifies
‘a small roll,' whence in a derived sense it came to mean small balls of per-
sume. who Rufillus and Gargonius may have been, we cannot oeu. .

94. De Capitolini sur-tis] Petillius Capitolinus was charged, accon-din to
some stories, with stealing the golden cmwn from the statue os Jupiter w en
he was in charge of the Capitol. That he was tried on some serious (εδοξε
and sequium, and that the vet-dict did not escape scandal, is clear from ο
context. See also S. 10. 26. The nature of the accusation must mmain a
matter of doubt. We may also guther that he was a person of influence from
v. 97, which he must have been, if he was acquitted, or supposed to have
been aequitoed, through the corruption of the jury.

105. insuevit puto· optimus Ιιοι· me,] ⁴ Suet-co ' and its compounds have an
active as well as a neuter signification, taking usually au accusative of the

raon and dativo of the thing, which order is inverted in virg. (Aen. vi.
gan: “Ne, pueri, ne tanta animis assuescite bella.” See below, S. ii. 2.
109 : “Pluribus assuerit mentem corpusque superbum.'' 1 am not. aware of
any instanees of a double accusative after ‘suesco' except this. The eon-

‚struction is that of the Grec-ka, who said'e’flisew τί τινα. ‘ Notando’ has
something of the technical sense. The father taught his son to avoid vices,

and enable him to continue it at Athens.
