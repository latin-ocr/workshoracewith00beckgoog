gitti} a feast at hin new house the victory of Augustus, which is described aa
‘ m eyewimoes.

Aneunur.— When shall we drink nuder thy tall roof, Maeeenas, to
Cmr the conqueror, aa late we did when the eon of Neptune lost his fleet
and ssed, —he who threatened us all with the chains bis slaves had worn?
Wiu our sons believe it ’ἐ Romans have sold themselves to serve a. woman
and her eunucha, and the luxui-iens ganzo bath ssuttered among the standai-ds
of war! But their alliee deaei-ted to om· side, and their ships skalked from
the sight. Io Triumphe! bring forth the golden chet-iot and the sacrifice.
So great a conqueror never came from Africa before. The enemy heth
changed his purple for monming, and bath fled to Crete ore the Syrtes, οι·
knoweth not whither to fly. Bigger caps, boy, -· Chian, or Lesbinn, or Ca-
eum, —- we wiu drown our old anxienee for Caesar in wine.
