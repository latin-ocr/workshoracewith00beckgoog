9. Exsomm's stupet Euius] This name sor the attendants on Bacchus, h'ke
Euius, his own name (C. i. 18. 93 ii. 11. 17), is derived from εὐοῖ (Enoc, C.
ii. 19. 7), the bacchanal cry. The Euiad catches in iration by looking out
froin the hill-tops upon the haunts os the god, and so t e poet turns aside fmm
his wonted path to the river-banks and gioves where Bacchus is found. The
picture os the Euiad looking out with silent awc, through a moonlight '’inssi-'s
night, upon the quiet plains of Thrace, and drawing inspiration from mum·
plating the soenes that her deity fnequents, is very beautiful.

ODE XXVI.

Tms Ode represents a successful gallant's first refusal, and his mortifion-
tion and wrath at his defeat. It is a purely sanciful composition.

“ Militiae speeies arnor est, discedite segnes '' (Α. Α. ii. 233) 3 “ Militat omnis
amans et habet sua eastra Cupido '' (Am. i. 9. 1). The arms this lover pro-
poses to hang up in the temple of Venus on the left wall, as being most pro-
pitious (but see next Ode, v 15, n.)‚ are the toi-eh that lighted him to his
mistress, the erowbar that lirokc open her door, and the bow and arrows which

he carried as emblems of his passion perhaps. For what other purpose he
could use them it is not easy to see.
