a man of studious habits, to Join it. The expedition was attendod with
nothing but disaster, aud the greater part of the force perishcd. But Iccius
survived‚ and we find Horace writing to him a few years later as 'ppa's
steward in Sicily (E p. i. 12). Be ond this, nothing is known o Iccius.
The Ode is a icce o good-tempe . jocular irony, of which the point fies
in the man ο books going forth as a conqueror to subdue fierce nations,
untamed before, and to return ladeu with the spoils of the East. Later
times have seen young and chivalrous men hastening to an El Dorado in
expectatiou of wealth and distinction, and finding nothing but disappoint-
ment3 and such appears to have been the ease on the occasion of this expe-
dition into Arabia. ο ι

3. Sabaeae] The Rg'mauzi’ had possession of parts of Arabia Petraea, but
not of Arabia Felix. Hence Horace says, ‘⁴ Intactis opulentior Thesauris
Arabum '’ (C. iii. 24. 1). It may have been reported that the army would
proceed against the Parthians, after the Arabs were conquered, or, as is
more probable, the ‘ horrible Mede ’ is only introduced to heighten the
coloriug of the picture in a jocular wa . .

5. (haas — varyinmn — barbam] very uncommon construction for
⁸ quae virgo barbara' or ‘ quae virginum barbararum.' There is humor in
the question, as ir Iccius had only ω choose sor himself some royal damsel,
whose betrothed he was to slay with his own hand, and an Eastcrn page of
great heauty‚ brought from his native wilds to wait upon one of the princes
of this happy land. If Horace mixes up Tartars (Sericas) and Parthians,
it only makes the picture more absurd.

Puer—exaula] ‘A royal page! Boys whose office it was to ur out
the wine, are calle'd in inscriptions ‘pueri a cyatho' or ‘ ad cy um,' or
‘ ab argento potoria,’ ⁴ ad argentum potorium,' ‘ a potione,' aud so forth.

9. saqittas wadan] For ‘arcum tendere! Virgil also says (Aen. ix.
606), ‘⁴ {gloria tendere cornu,” and (Aen. v. 508) “pariterque oculos telum·

ue tete 't.”

to have gathered the substance of his work De Officiis. He professcd the
doctrines of the Stoics, but seems to have qualified them with opinions de-
rived from the writings of Plato, and others of the Socratic school, which
accounts for their being mentioned in connection with his name. He
gourished in the second century n. c., and was intimate with the younger
