39. Mami peditis] Translate in the following order: ‘et Vultus Maun‘
peditis Acer in cruentum hostem.’ The force of ‘ peditis ' here appears to be
that the ridet· has had his horse killed under him, or has dismountcd to
attack his enemy hand to hand, or in consequence osa wound. See S. ii.
l. 13 : “ Aut labentis equo describit vulnera Parthi.'' The troops of Mauri-
tania were chiefly cavalry. There is a particular meaning in the reference
to them rather than to any other troops,

41. jaecvenem] So Augustus is called, though he was forty years old at this
fane. So νὺξ. (Georg. i. 500) : -

‘Juvenis ' and ‘ adolescens ' were used sor any age between ⁶ pueritia ’ and

See also Trist. v. 2. 47. The adjective for the adverb is common in respect
of time. The instanees in Horace are very numerous.

49. trim1aephos,] Augustus had just celebrated, or was just about to eelo-
bratc, three triumphs on three successive days, for his victories, (l.) over the
Gaul& Pannonians, and Dalmatiam, (2.) at Actium, and (3.) at Alexandria.
⁶ Triumphus ' is governed by ‘ames,’ as ‘ pocula ¹ is governed by ‘ spernit’-
