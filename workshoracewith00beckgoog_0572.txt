Horace says men are more apt to remembcr what is ridiculous than that
which is good and serious; and therefore it is not pleasant to have one's
name associated with silly verses or an ugly wax image, such as the admirere

. Horace speaks of being stretched out in an open box as if he were a corpse

being carried on a ‘ vilis ιιι-ω’ (S. i. 8. 9, n.) to the common burial-ground,
that is, to the grocer's shop ‘ Vicum ' may mean the ⁴ Vicus Thurarins,'
which was a part of the Vicus Tuscus mentioned S. ii. 3. 228. “ Porrectus '
is med commonly for corpses. ‘Aperta’ keeps up the notion of a ‘sanda-

ila,’ or common bier, on which the poor were carried out to burial. In plain
Knffluage, Horace says he might expect his panegyrist's verses to be carried
to e rocei- (to whom and the trun -maker waste paper goes still), and him·
sels to held up to ridicule with the author.
