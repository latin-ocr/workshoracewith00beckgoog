oftbe eas-lydowu upon a boy's eheck. 'Piieword is nowhere else used iu
this sense. ’Δπιλος was a name 'ven by the Greeks to beardless boys.
Boys’ hair was allowed to grow‘ti they assumed the ‘toga virilis,’ when
, it was cut off, as observed on C. ii. 5. 24. Thc seathers of a bird are as good

a likencss to the down on a oung cheek as wool, from which ‘ lanugo, the
usual word in this sense, is ἄζει-ἔνθά.

6. te sJaeculo videris] ‘ Speculo ' here, without ‘iu,’ is the ablative os the
instrument. ‘Alterum’ is nowhere else used exactly in this sense, ‘ muta-
tum,' and, though the word admits of that use, it is so like the Greek ἕτερον,
which is frequently so used, that 1 think it is a translation of that word-⁶
‘ Heu ’ is an exclamation of the poet, not of Ligurinas. What follows is like
two lines in Terence (Hec- i. l. 17, sq.) :—

“ Eheu me miseram ! cur non aut istaec mihi
Aetas et forma est ant tibi haec sententia ’ἒ ”
The min-ors of the Romans at this time were only of metal‚ glans mirrors
having been introduced later, and then of an inferior quality.

 

ODE xl.

Tms Ode professes to be an invitation to Phyllis to come and sup with
Horace on the 15th of April, Maecenas's birthday. It is possible that the
Ode, was sent to Maecenas himself, and was only thrown into the form of an
address to Phyllis for poetical convenience.

Aaouumvr. — 1 have a good old amphora of Alban, with parsley and ivy
to make thee a crown, Phyllis ; silver on my bonrd, and an altar that waits
for the sacrifioe; the slaves are busy, the firc is buming; come and celebrate
the Ides of April, for it is Maeceuas's birthday‚ more sacred to me than my
own. Telephus is matehed already, and is no match for thee. The satos of
Phaethon and Bellerophon teach. thee to beware of ambitiou. Come, m
last love, with thy sweet voice sing the song I shall teach thee; song
drive care away.

2. Albani eadm] The wine of the Alban hills was of the better kind3
and at Nassidienus’s sup r it was offered to the chief guest with Falernian
(Sat. ii. 8. 16). Pliny ( . H. xiv. 6) places it third among the wincs of
Italy. Juvenal (v. 33) speaks of Albanian wine, and classes it with sedan,
both of great age. The rich glutton drank it, he says, as a corrective of yes-

8. Βροτῃίεν aquo ,·] It has been questioned whether the Romans shed
blood on birthda . In the earliest times, perhaps they did not, but the

metice sigas <lingent in Horace's time, as this passage shows. See also

10. Clamitent mixtae pueris puellam] ‘Puellae' is most rarely used for
female slaves. The word in use was ‘ ancillae!

12. Venice firmum] ‘ Vertice' is the top of the flame, which ‘flickers
as it whirls the dark smoke ou its erest’; a spir-al flame, meminating iu a
column of smoke. It seems as if Homce were writing with a fire buming
before him, and caught the idea as he wrote

15. mon'nae] C. i 3. l. yenus (Ἀφροδίτη) was said to have risen from
the sea in the mouth of April, which was therefore her mouth, the name of

which Macrobius derives from deppds: verm, mom mabam-y, from ⁸ aperio:
