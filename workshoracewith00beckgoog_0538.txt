&mh-nummos& ifhe could have ηοω-αἱ to dcem hattho char,
aeter of Tiberius did not admit of warmth, and he would not have responderi
to any very ean-nest eulogy. Horace therefore satisfias himself with merely
naming his friend, and exea-ing his own boldness in doing so.

1. nimam] ‘ of eourae,’ it would be strange if it were otherwise. Horace
soluetimes uses the word seriously, sometimes ironieally, as in S. ii. 2. 106 3
3. 120. He says, ‘ Os course Septimius known my influence with you better
than an body else does (⁴unus,' see S. ii. 6. 57, n.), and better than 1 do my-
aelf, an thinks that 1 stand to you in the relation of an intimate friend, or
he would not prees me for an introduction.’ There is about the same amount
of ironieal meaning in ‘seilicet' (v. 3) as in ‘nimirum' ‘Tradere' is tho
usual word for introductione. (S. i. 9. 47.)

4. Dignam mente domoque] Tacitus sa s of Tiberias, that his genuine char-
acter did not come out fully till after e sall of Sejanus. At this time he
was about twenty-two years of , but even now was reserved and impleas-
ant in his manners so much so t at even Augustus could hardly be cheerful
in his eompan . iim-aee speaks well of him, not only here, when he is writ-

honor of his suetvesses, but there no great amount οἰ warmth is shown in his
favor. ‘Domo ' means his family. Tiberius was the son of Τ. Claudius
Nero, and the Nerones belonged to the patriciatu gens Claudia, which num-
bered man consuls and other high magistrates, from the first establishment
of the fami y in n. c. 504. Th were of Sabine origin.

⁶. Munere wmfitnqi This p rase is like ‘officium sacio’ below (Epp. 17.
21). It means to dise arge the duties of friendship, but generally ex resson
the relation os an inferior to one above him in rank, and sometimes used
in a bad sense, to signify servility.

l 6. αιὶάὶυἰς] This comparative occurs again, in A. P. 321 ε “valdius ob-
ectat ο ιι ιιιιι.”

11. p ronti& ad urbanae descendi praemia] ‘ Urbanae stontis ' seems to
mean an ‘impudent front,' such as one who had been bned in eities might
show, ‘Praemia' seems to be op sed to ‘ opprobria,’ and ‘descendere is
eommonl used iu connection wgo the arena. Horace ma mean (taking
his metap or stom this source), that, to avoid the discredit ο a greater fault,
he has resolved to win the cmwn or prize of impudenoe, or something of that
tort.

13. Scribe tui ‚qr-eya] This construction with the genitive is more common
in Greek. It occurs ιιι C. iii. 13. 13; “ Fies nobilium tn qnoque fontium.” ·
Aa ω ⁴ sortem bonumque,' see C. iv. 4. 29, n.

 

EPISTLE X.

Tms Epistle is addressed to Fuscus Aristius, whose name ap in C. i.
22; S. i. 9. 61 ; 10. 83. For such particulare as can be stated ut him, see
the Introduction to the above Ode. It appears that his habits inclined him
to a town life. He was making mone in some way, and he was associated
with all Horaee's litemry and other ricnds. Horace praises the freedom,
the natural boemica, aud the healthincss of the country, and shows that they
are natural to men’s testes, from the attempta they make to get trees in their
town heusen, and a prospect over the fields. He follows this up with a (em-
miseellaneous mmm-ks on the putauit of wealth, how 'xt mmm xxxa exeam ἠῶ
