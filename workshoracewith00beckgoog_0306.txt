ODE IV.

ans amusing Ode resents a gentleman in love with his maid-servant,
and j0eularly consolesmflim with examples os heroes who had been in the
same condition, and with the assurance that one so faithful must be, like the
slaves os the Homerie warriors, the daughter of a ro al house. The name
Xanthias must be fictitious, and Phoceus indicates t at the rson was also

real or su friend, should also make him a Phoeian‚ is needless to
