vei-bini. Hence σῦκινοι ἄνδρες meant men fit for nothing. Priapus was n.
ται-81 divinity‚ ,horrowed by the Romans from the luter mythology of the
Greeks. He was the protector οι· flocks, licitis, und gardens,.s.nd symbolized
the fertility of nature generally. liis images were made in a rough fushion,
und the aucients had but little respect for him, unless it were those of the
lowest sort; though Horace, who treats him so contemptuously here, speaks
of him elsewhere (Epod. it), in conjunction with Silvanus, as receiving the
sacrifice due to him. No oue could better have apprecinted than a Roman

of Hor-soe’s way of thinking, whether, in respect to this dei or any other, ,

the ironical description of the prophet Isaiah (xliv. 9-20), w 'ch may be re-
ferred to with advantage. There is no stroke in the whole of that deseri tion
more severe than Homee’s ‘⁶ incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum luit
esse deum-'⁸ The figures of Priapus were generally haste, but sometimes
they were fun length, of the kind Horace describes. Usually they held a
sickle or a clnb in their right hund, by wa of frightening thieves, and a wisp
of straw, or something of that sort, to f ⁸ iten the birds.

6. importunas vdua-es] Virgil appliesnffns same epithet to destructive birds:
“ Obscoenseqne canes importunaeque volucres ” (beorg- i. 470). The word
is used with a variety of meanings, to reduce which to oue character we must
⁴know more than we do of its et 'mologffl

8. IIue prius unqu-etas] See ntroduetion. The poor people were buried
in ill-<lug graves, which had the name ‘ puticuli‚’ probabi a form of ‘putei'
The manner of their funeral is here stated with painfn satire. The poor
wretch is neglectcd by his insster3 and a follow-slave, ont of his ‘ peculium‚’

goes to the expense of hiring (⁴1ocabat’) ‘vespillones’ (common corpse-

bearers, νεκροφόρους) to carry him out on u hier to the public barini-ground,
where his eorpse was tossed naked into a pit into which other corpses had
been tossed before. This soene could not have occurred in ull its particulare

master of the slave. The ‘vilis ω’ was called ‘sandapile,’ a bier of nar-
row dimensione.

ll. Pantolabo mnne Nomentanoque nepoti .·] As to these persons, see note
on S. l. 101. In conse uence of their extmvngunoe, Priapus foretells they
will come to s nuper-'s eral.

12. Mille pafa m finum] This public buriul-gronnd was 1‚ooo feet in
breadth und 300 in depth. ‘ In fronte' means sut-ing the public road, the Via
*Tiburtina (6. 108), or the Via Praenestina, one os which, or both, must have
passed very close to it. (See Caesar, B. G. ii. 8, and Mr. Long’s note.) It
was usual to engruve on monuments the following letters, 11. ιι. ιι. ιι. 5.,
which stand for ‘⁴ Hoc monumentum heredes non sequitur-”3 or 11. ιι. u>
ιι. x. rmus. The words were sometimes given nt full length. Sometimes
nx τ. (ex testamento) were inserted between ιι. and ιι. Such sepulchres
were called ‘sepulcra familiariu'; those that were built for n mun und his
heirs were called ‘mmmm-ia! Horace writes ss if fluere were n stone
(‘ cippus ') which defined (‘ dabat ’) the extent os this barini-ground, und
bore the inscription usual on private monuments, ιι. ιι. ιι. ιι. s„ which is
obviously only a satire. The words could only sppl to a private luce of
burial. All he reali means ie, that a space of groun of the extent e men·
tions wns marked o for the buriul of these poor ople.

14. Nunc lieet Esquiliis] Tho whole of the ' uiline or fifth region 'of
Rome was called Esquiliae. This, from having n an eye-sore und a
