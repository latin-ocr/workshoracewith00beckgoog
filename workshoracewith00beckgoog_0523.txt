EPISTLE III.

In Β. o. 20 an embassy came from Armenia to Rome, expressing· the dis·
satisfaction of the people with their king, Artaxias, and prayin'} that Augus·
tus ννῖιιὶᾱ place upon the throne that king’s younger brother, igi-anes, who
vas t en i
with Tigranes to ‹lethi-one Artaxias. This Tiberius did, and with his own
hand crowned Tigranes. (See Epp. 12. 27, n.)

About his person Tiberius appears to have had a number of young men,
such as Titius, Celsus, and Munatius, mentioned in this Epistle, and Julius
Florus, to whom it is addressed. What little can be said about the first
three will be found in the notes. Florus, it appears from this Epistle (v, 23).

same information.

Quintilian (Inst. Orat. x. 3) tells an anecdote of ono Julius Florus, whom
he calls the first man in Gaul sor eloquence. This may be the person Horace
addresses, and if so, he carried out suecessfnlly in Gallia the pursuit of which
Horace here supposes him to be beginning the raetice. Horace had a. at
segurd for him, as appears not only from this, ut from the other Epis e, in
which he makes his excuses to him for not having sent him any poetry.

Florus was evidently a young man at this time, and all the pomona named
