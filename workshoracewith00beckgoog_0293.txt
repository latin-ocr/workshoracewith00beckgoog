·ODE XXX. ⁹

1¹1· is not improbable that-the main incident of this Ode, that of a lady
sacrifieing or dedicatmg a little ehupel to Venus, is taken from life; but

there is a fragment of one of Alcman's poems‚ running Κύπρον ἱμερτὰν
ἒέξῐοξῑῖ ἱξὶΐὸῑέέφον περίῤῥυτον, which appears to have been imitated in the

Anoounxr. — Royal Venus, leave th beloved C prus, and come, dwell
in Gl cere's temple. Let Love come πίιίζ thee, and t e Graees and Nymphs,
and outh, who is unlovely without thee, and Meu-cury too.

but the latest practice lay between the two, and they were painted and sculp-
tured with loose, tmnsparent drapery. Horace varies in his descriptions.
See C. i. 4. 6; iii. 19.16; iv. 7. 6.

⁷. Et parum eornt‘s sine te Juoentas] Cupid (‘ fervidus puer ⁹) or several
Cupids (C. 19. 1), Youth (Ηβη), HermeS, the god of eloquence, Persuasion
(Πειθώ), and the Grae-ea, were the principal companions of Venus, accond-
ing to the notions of the Greeks. The nymphs of the woods, or of the hius,
were likewise usually represented ss her eompanions. (See C. iv. 6.)

 

ODE XXXI.

In no. 28 (25th October , Au stus dedicated a temple, with s. librar-y
attached, which he had bui t in onor of Apollo, on the Palatino Hill, ιο
commemorate his victory at Actium. After t-he ceremonies of the day of
dedichtion were over, we may sup se Horace putting in his own claim to
the god's favor in this Ode, in w ich he represents himself as offering a.
libation (whether in private or at the temple is uncertain), and nsking for
that which, according to Juvenal (x. 356), should bo the end of all prziyer,
‘ mens sana in corpore sano ! '

Auentinum-what asks the poet of Apollo? Not eups, or herbs, or
gold and ivor-v, or rich fields. Let those who may mne Calenian vines
aud rich merchants drink rich wine out of cups of 01AE favorites of heaven:
who traverso the deep in safety. My food is the o ive, the ehieory, and the
mallow. Let me enjoy what 1 have, thou son of Leto, sound in body and
mind, and let my ago pass with honor and the lyre-
