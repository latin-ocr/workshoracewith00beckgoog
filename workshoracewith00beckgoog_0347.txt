ODE xl.

Tmo is an addi-ess to tho. lyre, calling upon it for a son to win the hem
of Lyde. The rincipal subject is the story of the Danai ee, who mnrdered
their humanda, ut mone articularly of the one who spared hera. Tho pun·
ishment of the sistere sor t eir eruesty, and the teudorness of Hypermnestrn,
are the wanting and example by which Lyde is to be που.

lead. The inscription should be An Tnsrnnmmt, if anything ; sor Moecury

phion'S, were those of OrpheuS, und of the lvre in his hand5‚ not Met-eury’s,
