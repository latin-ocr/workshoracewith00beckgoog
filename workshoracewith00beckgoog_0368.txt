stellatum Oanis Minor, and called ‘ Ante Canem ⁹ by a literal version of the
Greek name, rises about the same time, and the sun enters Leo: see above,
C. iii3 13. 8, n. ‘ Stella ⁹ is not commonly put for ⁴ sidus,’ the constellation,
ιιιε51ξὲ,18Τὴιῗιιιῗιῖινῆαιεετιι·] ‚See Introduction. As to ‘regnata,' see C. ii. 6. 11.
The Seres represent indefinitely the farthest Eastern natione known to tho
Romans (see C. i. 12. 56). The Bactriaus were formerly part of the Pcr-
sian empne, and were at this time artly subject ιο the Parthians and
partly to a Scythian race, the Tochari. aetra was their capital. The mean-
ἕης of Horace is, that Maeeenas should not trouble himself about improbable
angers.

34. aequore] ‘ Aequore ³ is equivalent to ‘ alveo,' the channel os the river.
Virgil has “ viridesque secant placido aequore silvas '' (Aen. viii. 96). The
next line describes well the quiet flow os a river.

43. ems vel alm] Compare C. ii. 10. 15. On ⁸ diffinget‚' see O. i. 35. 39.
‘ Vexit ' is employed unusually sor ‘ avexit!

49. Fortuna samo] The caprice of Fortune‚ represented as a coquette
transferring her favors from one favorite to another, and dclighting to trifle
with the happiness of men, is the lowest Epicurean view of life and the
world’s government. But Horace writes conventionally. He has just aa·
signed to the Father of all the ordering os men's lives.

51. Transmutat iunci-tos bonorem] Compare C. i. 34. 12, sqq.

53. εἰ ederes quatit] Horace uses ¹ si ' where other writers would use ‘ sin!

54. ναίφιο] This is equivalent to ‘ rescribo’ in a money sense, ‘ to pay
back! ‘ Mea virtute me involvo ’ is a picture of sels-satisfaction. The man
wraps his cloak of virtue complacently emund him, and sits down in con-
tented indifference to the proceedings of Fortune, as is she had nothing to do
with him, and unitee himselfto verty, as ιο a bride without a portion.

60. cypriae Tyr-ineque merces Cyprus abounded in copper and other
metals, including gold and silver, ther with precious stenes. It exported
winus also and 011. The trade of P oenicia, which at this time formed part
of the Roman province of Syria, was carried on through Sidon more largely
than T , which, however, was a rt of some consequence under the emper·
ors. &sace is speaking gener-all} and ‘ Tyriae meroes ¹ ananei-ed his pur-
pose as well as any other expression.

62. biremis —seaphaeJ A two-oarcd boat, ἐλάτης δικώπου. ‘ Biremis ⁸ is
not so used elsewhere, but sor two banks of oars.

64. seret] See above, C. iii. 9. 12, n. ¹ Geminasque Pollux ' is an ellip-
tical way of expressing ‘Pollux cum gemino fratre! See C. i. 3. 2.

ODE XXX.

Tms Ode appears to have been written as an epilogus ιο the first three
books, as C. i. l was the prol e. 1t expresses the conviction, which time
has justified, that, throu h his dee, Horace had achicved an immor-tal name.
The same just pride h been shown by poeta before him ; as by Sappho, in
a poem of which the first line only has been preserved, μνάσασθαί τινά

pu καὶ ὕστερον ἀμμέων (16 Bergk); and by Ennius, in the lines (see

. ii. 20. 21, n.), — - ·

‘⁸ Nemo mc lacrimis decoret nec funera fletu
Faxit. Cur? volito vivu’ per ora virum,’'
which words virgil has made his own (Georg. iii. 9). Propertius (iii. 1),
0de (Met. xv. 871, sqq.)‚ aud Martial (x. 2. ⁷, sqq.) have au imitated.
· Hm very closely.
