'ia different from the person mentioned below, v. 107, it is not easy to say

- 25. ique tribunat] Each legion in the Roman army (the number varied
at ‹li erent times, but at Philippi there were nineteen on each side, euch
legion consisting of about 6,000 men, rather less than-more) had six tribunes
(the post Horace held in the army of Brutus), who were their principal
'ossieem The military tribunes os the first four legions were entitled to sit in
the senate. (See Epod. iv. 15, n.) As to the ‘ latus clavusf see note on the
emh verse of the last Satire. *Quoss ‘to what purpose! (See C. ii. 2. 9, n.)

27. Mun ut quisque insanus] The senators' ‘calceum' en out-door shoe,
vnis fonteneti by four thongs (⁴ nigris pellibus '), two on each side, which went

- 30. quo'morbo Bon-und His disense was a thirst for admiration among
women. He was a mun of bad passione, it is said. But we do not know
much about him. He need not be identified with the-man in S. 4. 110. Α
foul-mouthod person of the same name occurs in the next Satire (v. 8).

34. Sic qui promittit] This refers to the promises of candidates for office,
and the three principal magistrneies are implietl: the city praetorship, in the
worda ‘urbem eibi curae'3 the consulship, in ‘imperium et Italiam’; und
the aedileehip, in ‘delubra deorum,' because it was the duty of the oedile to
ettend to the temples and other public buildings.

38. Syr-i, Ιλιπκιε, out Dionysi] These were ⁴common names os slaves.
The praetiee of executing criminals by throwing them from the 'rm-poian
Rock (part of the Mons Capitolinus? was not common in the latter period
of the republie. It was never epp ied to slaves, who were put to death,
chiefly by crucifixion, ouoeide the city on the Esquiliae. ( See Epod. v. 99, n).
Cadmus is said to have been a public executioner of that day.

40. Ae Novius] The upstart who is supposed to be addreseed in the re·
vioue lines, is a plebeiun tribune, and he here affirma that, if his birth is ow,
that of his eolleague Novius (who may be anybody, see note on S. 3. 21) is
niu lower. Freedmen, und pensons following low trades, were admitted into
the senate, and forced into high magistu-acies by Julius Coesur, and it was not
tin nome years nster this Satire was written that Augustus purged the senate
of these membera. The words ‘ gradu post me sedet uno ' may be a metaphor
tuken· ἰτοιὲι the theatro, of which the first fourteeu rows were assigned to the

' uites . iv. 15 n. .
Equ- doc ξ’ἶιᾲΡαυΙὶυῖ Eg Messalla] These were names belonging to two of
the most distinguished semilies os Rome, the AEmilia end Valeria. Horace
introduoeo the name Messalla probably out of eompliment to his friend Cor·
vinus, for whom he wrote C. iii. 21. As to ‘hoc‚' in the sense of ‘propter
hoe,' see above, S. 1. 46, n. The same person who uts the question ‘ tune
Syri, eto? ⁹ is here supposed to rejoin, saying, that, 310 h this worthy trib-
une has a eolleague a degree less iuustrious than himsel , he need not think
himself a Paullum und besides, though Novius be his inferior in one way, he
beate him in strength of lunge, ‘⁴ and that is what we like,” where the speaker
imnieell puts himself sor the ple.

from his house, with the noise ot trumpets and horus and tifex und women
