meets (see S. i. ιθ. 75, n.). His writings came very soon to take their place
with Homer and Virgil in all the schools. See Juvenal (vii. 226) :
“ Quot stabant pueri, curn totus decolor esset
Flaccus, et haereret nigro fuligo Maroni.” ·

baths, people read to themselves or one another. lt is not easy to see the
connection of this line with what goes before. It is something of a contra-
diction. But he supposes the book may perhaps be popular for a time.

erals, Brutus and Cassius. The description he gives of himself corresponds
with that we find in his biographer. See also C. ii. 11. 15. Epp. i. 4. 15.

28. Colleyum lapidum] Horace was born on the eth of December, n. c. 65,
in the year of the consulship of L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius Cotta.
He completed his forty·f0urth year, therefore, in December, n. c. 21. In that
year M. Lollius (to whom C. iv. 9 is addroesed) and Q. AEmilins Lepidus
were consuls. ‘ Duxit ⁹ merely means that he had Lepidus for his colleague.
Why Horace should be so particular in letting the world know his present
