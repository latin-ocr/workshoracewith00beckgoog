Apollo is almost always represented with a bow and urowa, or a lym, or
both. Homer has many epitheta describing him with his bow. The ancients
believed him ιο be the punisher ol the wicked and the author of all sudden
deaths among men, as Diana (Artemis) was among women. He was the
god ol music, but got his lyre from Mercury (C. i. 21. 12, n).
