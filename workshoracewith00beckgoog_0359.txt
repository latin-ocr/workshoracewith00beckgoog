ODE XXII.

Romen on some occasion thought fit to dedicate a pino in his guden ιο
Diana, and wrote these two stanzas as an inscription perhaps. The dedica-
tion ot‘ trees to particular divinities was not uneommon.

Amuunnr. — Diana, who roteetest the mountains and woods, and deliv-
ffitfivggnger: aghildbirth, to nee 1 dedicate this pino, and will offer thee the

ο .

1. Montium—nemorumque, See C. i. 21. 5, and C. S. l. Diana share-d
with Juno the attributes os ucina, the divinity that brings children to the
birth, as ex lained on C. S 13. Diana was ⁸ Diva triformisss as being Luna
in Heavem iana on Earth, and Hecate in Hell3 whenoe Virgil speaks of
“ Tergeminamque Hecaten tria virginis ora Dianae ” (Aen. iv. 511), alluding
(as Horace does) ιο the statuoe of the goddess, with three faces, set up where
three roads met, so that she could look down all three at onee, from which
she was called Trivia.

2. laborantes utero} For ‘ parturientes!

5. tua —estol ‘ be sacred to thee..’

6. Quam >er exactos eqo laetus armos} The antecedent to ‘ quam ' is implied
in ¹ tun.' ‘ er exactos annos ' means ‘ every year,’ as each year is finishcd.

7. obliquum meditantis ictum] This expresses the way in which a bom·
strikes at an object with one of its projecting tusks, with which a wild hog
has not raml bcen known, when incautiously pursucd, to rip open a horse’n
belly. See vid, Met. viii. 3⁴4 ε “obliquo latrantes dissioat ictu.''

 

ODE XXIII.

Honaca, wishing to embody tho principle that any offering to heaven is
table according to a man’s means (see note on v. 20), put it into the
form osan address to the plain and pions Phidyle, a person of his own crea-
tion, bringing a humble offering to her Lares with doubts as ιο its acceptance,
or lamenting that she eould not, for her poverty, offer a worthier sacrifice.

Ausonum—My hnmble Phidyle, list thy hands to heaven, and bring
the Lares but incense, fresh corn, nnd a sticking-pin, and they shall protect
thy vines and fields and lambs. Ilei-ds and flocks, sed on Algidus or Alba,
are sor the pontifices : do thou but crown thy gods with rosemary and mvr-
tle, sor ituis 3110 clean hand and not the eostly sacrifice that eomes with aceept-
ance ιο e tar.

l. supinas] The elasping of the hands in prayer does* not seem to have

been usual with the ancients. ‘ Supinus ' and ὕπτιος contnin the same ele-
ment, and both signify ‘upturncd’ The ‘ s ' in the Latin word corresponds

to the aspirato of the Greek. as in ‘ silva’ and ὕλη. As to ⁴ nascente Luna,'

see C. iii. 19. 9, n. Phidyle is derived from φείδεσθαι, and means ‘t11rifty.’
The prosc form of ‘ hornus ' is ‘ hornotinus!

4. Lam] These were thc Manes or spirits of deceased members os a snm-
ilv, who were worshipped as Penates or honsehold gods (see below, v. 19. nnd
ΕΠ). ii. 2. 209, n.). Their altar wns usually in the atrium or entrance-hall.
The had libations and prayers offered to them daily at the principal meal
and lind especial saoeifiees on the Kalends, Neues, and Ides. ⁹
