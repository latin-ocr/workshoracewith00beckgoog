ODE V.

11« the year Β. c. 53, M. Licinius Cremna, as consul, with the province of
Syria, marehed an army into Mesopotamia against the Parthians. lle sus·
tamed a disastrous defeat at the hands of Surenae, the Parthian general, and
lost his own life, with 20,οω men killed and 10,000 prisonem, besides several
angles. A ἠ, ἰιι the year Β. c. 36, Μ. Antonius attached the Parthians, and
was ο “ ιο ται-εει with great loss.

There would seem ιο have been generally prevalent nt Rome a feeling of
soreness and impatience under the d· ce, so long unredeemed, of these
revemee3 and this feeling it appears to Horace’s purpose in this Ode ιο
allay, and ιο diseournge any hope or desire for the return of the Parthian
prisonem. This desire Horace seems to imputo ιο a ‹lt-generate spirit, and
the story of Regulus is introduced apparently ιο eall back men's minda ιο the
feeling of a former generation.

The standards and many of the prisonem were restored by Phraates, n. ‘o-
20, as an act of concilietion towards Augustae, and their ret-every was pro-
claimed as a triumph, and recorded upon eoins with the inscription ‘⁸ Signis
receptis.’' This fiction is repeated in C. iv. 15. 6. Epp. i. 12. 27 ; 18. 56.
