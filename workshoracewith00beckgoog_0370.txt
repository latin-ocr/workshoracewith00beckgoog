3. Non num quatis mm] Epp. i. 1. 4. Hc here calls Cinara good, be·
cause she is dead3 elsewhere he calle her ‘ rapax ' (E p. i. 14. 33). It seems
likcl that this name represents a real pert-mn, whether she appears under
an er name elsewhere or not, aud that Horace had au affection for her.
In the thirteenth Ode os this book (v. 22) her death is mentioned with feeling, ’
and there is a reality in the references to her in all the places where she rs
alluded to, which cannot he connected with fiction. She was associated, iu
all probability with Horace's early days. Κυνάρα significa, some say, a wild
rose-thom (κννόσβοτος); nemi ‚ an artichoke.

5. Mata- εαωα Cupidinum] peuted from i. 19. 1. Horace here does not
copy himself, 1 believe, but some Greek original. ‘ Flectere ' is a memphor

satum ibis,’ and therefore the reading ‘in domum ' is correct. Κωμὰσδο

„ ποτὶ τὸν ' ’λλιδα is an expression of Theocritus just like this (iii. 1).

xio χρὲεσ αι ἐς ἀλλήλους occurs in Herodotus (i. 21). ‘Pul-puteis?
(wffi signifies beauty without reference to color) savors of the Greek.
⁴ Tor-rere jecur' is like Theocritus's ὀπτώμενοι· ἐξ Ἀφροδίτης (vii. 55}3

14. murenas non tacitus reis] Compare C. ii. 1. 1³, where he calls ollio
‘⁴ Insigne moestis raesidium reis.”

22. Duces ilium] ‘Ducere’ is used for drinking, and here for inhaling.

March, during the festival of Mars, the Salii, his priests, went iu processioa
through the city sing-in and dandug, whence they are' said to have derived
their name. “Jam de erat Saliis (a saltu nomina ducunt) '⁹ (Ovid, F. iii.

urbemSee E irecarlncrgzes carmina cum tripudiis sollennique saltatione jussi sunt.”
