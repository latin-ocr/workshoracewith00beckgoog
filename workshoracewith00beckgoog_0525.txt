EPJSTLE IV.

Tms Epistle is addmssed to Albius Tibullus, the poet, to whom also 0.
i. 33 is written. The letter only professes to be one to inquire asper Tibul-
lun bnt occasion is taken to commend his foi-tunes and himself, and to bid
him live every day as if it were the last. Horace mites to his friend (proba-
bly from Rome) at his laee near Pedum, a town of Latium, not far from
Praeneste. There Tibu lus had a good estate, inherited from his father,
which. before his death, he appears by some means to have diminished.
That his losses must have occurred nster this Epistle was written, we may

thaps infer from v. 7. He lived chiefly on his estate, in the quiet pun-suits

orace here supposes him to be en *ngr-d in3 though immediately after the
battle of Actium he accompanied R essalla into Gaul, and was absent about
a year, which, as far as we know, eom rised all his active life. Horace,
among other blessings, assigns him good calth; nevertheless he died young.
It appears that, while many dispas-agee Horaee’s writings, Tibullus Judged
them kindl , and the affeetmn the two pot-ts bore one another eannot be mis-
taken. Tibullus was probably ten or twelve years younger than qunoe.
Tibullus died the same year with virgil (n. c. 20), or very soon afuer-
