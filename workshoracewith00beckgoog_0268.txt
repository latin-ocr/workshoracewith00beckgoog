ODE VI.

Tms Ode is uddoessed to M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the friend and muci-al,
. und st a later time the son-in-luw, of Augustus. It was robabl written

after the battle of Actium, where Agrippa commanded the fuet of agustus·

honor, and he declines in a modest way, professing to be unequal to such
high exploits‚ which he places on the same level with those of Homer’s

heroes.
