κ from the Epistle to Florus, that Horace at this time had to resist

the urgeqcy of friends begging him to write, one in this style
and another in that, aud that he had no desire to gratify them
and to sacrifice his own ease to a pursuit in which it is plain he
never took any great delight. He was likely to bring to it less
energy as his life was drawing prematurely to a close, through
infirmities either conti-acted or aggravated during his irrational
campaigning with Brutus, his inaptitude for which he appears
,afterwards to have been perfectly aware of. He continued to
apply himself to the study of moral philosophy till his death,
which took place, according to Eusebius, on the 27 th of Novem-
δεῖ, Β. 0. 8, in the asty-sevam year οε his age, and within a
few days of its completion. Maecenas died the same year, also
towmdsthe close of it; a coincidence thet has led some to the
notion, that Horace hastened his own death that he might not
have the pain of surviving his panon. According to Suetonius,
his death (which he places aster his fistyminth year) was so
sudden, that he had not time to execute his will, which is opposed
to the notion of suicide. The two friends were buried near one
another ‘⁴ in extremis Esquiliis‚” in the fai-thest pert of the Es-
quilias, that is, probably, without the city walls, on the ground
drained and laid outingardens byMaecenas. (SecS.i.8,In·
troduction.)
