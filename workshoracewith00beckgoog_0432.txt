his own language (v. 20), that he was good-tempered, notwithstanding his
satirical vein g. 53), and again that he was very nnreserved and frauk (S. ii.
-1. :inv-34). he fingments of Lucilius that have come down to us ane too
short to form a very accurate opinion u n, but in some points, at least, (such
as the absurd mixture of Greek and tin‚) they bear out Horaee's stats-
ments.

7. Mutuus tantum pedibus] The writings of Lucilius ap to have been
very carly divided by the grammat-iaus into thirty books, o which two thirds
were written in hexameter verse, and the rest in the iambic and 'e
mensures. That Lucilius imitated the comedians in all but their m res,
cannot be true. The character of their plays could not 'bo transferred to
satirical poeuis like his, though some of theu· features might suit, as their
coarsencss and personalities.

8. Emunctao nans] ‘ Emunctae naris ' is one who has his none well wi ,
ῗῃᾶ is {hereret-e no driveller. Phaedrus explains it in his description of

l· iii. 3, V· 14 ²·.-
'“Aesopus ibi stans naris emunctae senex,
Natura nunquam verba cui poterit dare.'’
‘Emungem' is used by the comic writers for ‘chcating‚' as among other
laces (see A. P. 238) m the fragment from the Epiclerus of Caecilius quoted
gy Cicero de Am. 26. “ To wipc a man’s none for him, is to imply that he
is a driveller who cannot do it for himself, and hence it means to ‘outwit'
, aud to ‘cheat’ him.'' (Long in loco). Others explain ‘emunctae naris' as
‘keen-soented: like a hound, which is wrong.

10. umus dictabat] Sce S. 10. 92, n. The words ‘stans pede in uuo’ .
mean with the utmost facility, or ‘ standing at case,' as we might say. Othen
explain ‘stans pedo in uuo’ to mean within the time a man could stand ou
one foot. The other is right.

ll. Gmnflueret lutulentus] ‘ Lutulcntus ' combines two notious, dirtiness
and obscurity. Lucilius may have imitated the obscenity of the old eomo-
disus ; and in this, as in other rcspccts, his verse ma have boon like a mud-
dylstream. The wond, no doubt, comprehends dc ets os tusto as well as
st 0.

y12. piqer scrt‘bmdz' serre laborem] ‘Piger ferro' is a Greek construction,
common in the Odes, but not so in the language of the Satires. (See C. i.
1. 18, n.) In C. iv. 14. 22, we have ‘ impiger' in the same construction.

14. Crispinus minimo] See S. i. 1. 120, n. ‘Minimo me provocat,' ‘he
offers me the greatest odds,’ literally, ‘he challenges me at tho smallest
amount' to be staked on my side, while he puts down a large ono on his.
'nae mention of the negligent way in which Lucilius wrote, leads outo the
mention of small poets of the day, Crispinus and Fannius. See Iun-odue-
mll5.Aoe1‘piam aba& This is nothing more than a polite challenge to
nee which could write most verses in a given time. ‘ Take tablets if you

lcase, and 1 will take them too.'' The omission of the pemonal pronoun
Kefom ‘acci iam’ to ex ress antithesis, is nothing in familiar talk, where
there could no mista e. ‘ Custodes ’ are umpires to see that them is no
foul la . ⁸

18? αἶ’-ο d perpauca loquenda] ‘ The gods have done me a kindness in
making me of a poor aud unpretending disposition, that speaks but soldom,
ancil ‘very little· at a time! This is Horace's neply to the challenge, which he

ec mes.

19. A! tu conclusas] Persius imitatos this, S. v. 10.

21. Beatus Fannius] This Fannius is spoken of in another lace (S. i. 10.
80) as a contemptible pei-son, and a parasite of Hermogenes 'lpigeliius (S. 8.
120, n.). It appears probabis, from Horaoe's words, that he had his admir-
