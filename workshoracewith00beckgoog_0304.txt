little. But during the civil wars of Julius Coesar, S in, Greece, an Africa
were soenes of much bloodshed‚ and Romans song t against each other at
Mutina, at Philip i, and at Aetium. That the Parthian had heard the crash
of Italy in its sal , is a poetical exag- ration, meaning, in plain prose, that
the bitterest enedny of Ιῖοωο had wate ed her dissensione, and reJoteed in the

ODE 11.

Romen, meaning to write an Ode on the moderate desire aud use ot·
wealth, dedicated it to C. Sallustius Crispus, grand-nephew of the histor-ian,
and inheritor os his property. He had previously alludcd to him in no
terms of praise in Sat. 1. 2.·48; but that Satire was written many years
before this Ode, and at this time Sallustius was in high favor with AugustuS,
and possessed of great riches, of which Horace implies that he made a

gooduse.

Axonam-r. — Silver hath no beauty while hid in the earth, Sallustius.
Proculeius, for his genemsity to his brethren, will live for ever, and the man
who mles the s irit os avarico is a greater king than if from Carthago to
Gades were all is own. The dropsy grows and grows„ till its⁴ cause is
expelled. Phraates, restored to his throne, is not happy3 he only is a king
and conqueror who looks on money with indifferenee.
