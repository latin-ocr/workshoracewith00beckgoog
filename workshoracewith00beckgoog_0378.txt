ODE vl.

Tim appointmeut of Horaee to eompose the principal Ode at the Secular
Games, a. o. 17, seems to have given him much pleasure, and to have given
h‘a mind a new stimulus in favor of ode-writin . To the honor thus confer-
red upon him we ‘’weffrham as much as to ugustus's bidding, this fourth
book, of which the th‘ , sixth, ei hth, and uinth, all bear marks of the legiti-

of the man family; and having prayed for and obtained the help of that
god for the task he is going to perform, Horace turns, as choragus, to the

members of his chorus, ’consisting of twenty-seven bo s and as many girls of a

noble birth (C. S„ Int.), and instruens them in their uty.

mouumen— Ο thou, the punisher of Niobe and Tityos, and the slayer
of Achilles, he who shook the walls of Tro * was no match for thee, but feu
under thy strength as the pina-nee laid low y the axe, or the cypress by the
east wind. He would have taken Troy, not. by guile but by eruel force, but
that Jove had granted AEneas to th prayers and those of his dear Venus. O
Apollo, support the honor os the oman Muse. His spirit is upon me ε ye
virgins and boys, keep time to m song, and sing of A llo and Diana. Ο
damsell when a bride, thou shalt l'ook back and say, ‘¹ ffien the age brought
back its festival, 1 sang the pleasant song that the poet Horace made.”

1. Dina] The pu οἱ the Ode being to invoke the assistance of Apollo
for the composition o the Secular- Ode, the invocation is suspended here, and
not taken u again till the praiscs of the god have been sung, as the avenger
of crime an the destroyer of Achilles.

proles Niobea] The number of Niobe’s children is stattxl variously by dif-
ferent. authors. The version best known is that which Achilles gives to
Priam, when he is comforting him for Hector (Il. xxiv. 602-617), that she
had six sons and as many daughters, and that, because she had boastfully
compared the number of her offspring with that of Lato’s, who had but Arte·
mis and Apollo, these two shot all her children, who were turned to stone by
Zeus. She was afterwards changed to stone herself. considerable remains
of a up ot' lig-ures, said to be by Scopas (C. 8 6), representing Niobe and
her c ildpen, exist in the Gallery at Florence.

moysae—linquae] This is a close copy of Ζεὺς γὰρ μεγάλης γλώσσης
triga-og Ὓῖτρε Oai ,ε ( 1ssng Antig. 127).

θ’. alfoz? This is an Homeric epithet for Tro ,Ἴλιος αἶποινὴ.

4. Phthius Achilles] See C. ii. 16. 19, n. e death of Achilles by the
hand os Apollo was foretold by Hector (Il. xxii. 358, sqq.), aud is stated by
Sophocles (Philoct. 3³4),—

τέθνηκεν ἀνδρὸς οὐδενὸς θεοῦ δ’ ὕπο
· rogando, ὧς λ’ ουσιν. ἐκ Φοίβου δαμείς-
The common legend assigna it to aris, but not without Apollo’s help (Vix-g.
Aen. vi. 57). The eountry from which Achilles is said to have come was
Phthiotis in Thessaly.

14. malefetiatoe] ‘ keeping untimely holiday! The chorus in the Troades
ot' Euripides (541, sqq.) relates how there was sing-ing and dancing and ‘oy in
the city for the departure of the Greeks, when the cry of battle was su denly
heard, children clung to their mothers’ gat-ments, armed men kent. inaniat
