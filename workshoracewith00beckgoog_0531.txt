50. Mercemur mum] There was a cluss of slaves called ‘nomenclatores '
or ‘fartores’ (crammcrs), ὀνοματολόγοι, whose office it was to ⁸ceompnny
their master when walking, or ιτα-1111 111111 at home at the hour of ‘salutatio '
(when, if he was 11 mon of consequence, people of an sorta came to pay him
their respecta), andpeto remind him of the names aud circumstances! of his
visitem, ancl anything else that it might be necessary sor the musterto re-
membcr. 1f he was uiming at uny office, he had to be particularly polite to
the citizens of ⁸11 classes, and his ‘ nomenclator,’ if he were elever, would be
of good service to him in this matter. Ilomce’s advice to the m⁸n who
thinks happiness dependo on such things us show and populuity (species et

ia ’) is, that he should hire a elever ‘nomenclator‚' if he had not one of

is own, to go with him through the suet-ts, und nud him whenever he
came to any one of influent-e, und remind him to shake ands aud aa some-
thing civil to him, calling him affectionately ‘my brother,' ‘my fa er,' ac·
eording to his age. ‘ Nomenclatores ' were also employed to explain to the
ests the nimos and qualities os the dishes, and pmusites sometimes took

is office upon themselves, ns we have seen in S. 11. 8.
