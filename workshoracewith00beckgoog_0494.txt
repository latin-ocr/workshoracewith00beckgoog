nian raisins at the second course, and li ewiee ‘ faex ' and ‘ allec‚' two picklee,
or two names for the sume, being the lees of the ‘ muria ’ (v. 63, n.). Cetius

. also cleims the merit of introducing little dishee containing a mixture of salt

and white pepper. The object of all this, as well es the pickles‚ was to pro·
mete thirst, eud edd to tho pleasure of drinking aster dinner. white peppcr
is milder than blank. It is made by blanching the finer gmina of the hunck,

aster he had been ther-ing and licking up the remeius of the dishee, would
leave the marks ogahis fin rs upon it, and this would turn the stomachi! of
the company, who would ‹fieso be disgusted if th saw dirt upou the ‘ cratera’

There were woodon and earthen-ware ‘ calice& and others of common glake,
